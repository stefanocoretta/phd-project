%  Body of the article
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The position of the tongue root during the production of voiced stops
plays a fundamental role in ensuring that voicing can be sustained. The
realisation of vocal fold vibration (i.e.~voicing) requires a difference
in air pressure between the cavities below and above the glottis.
Specifically, the sub-glottal pressure needs to be higher than the
supra-glottal pressure for voicing to be maintained. This property of
voicing is formally known as the Aerodynamic Voicing Constraint
\citep{ohala2011}. When the oral tract is completely occluded during the
production of a stop closure, the supra-glottal pressure quickly
increases, due to the incoming airstream from the lungs. Such pressure
increase can hinder the ability to sustain vocal fold vibration during
closure, to the point in which voicing ceases.

An articulatory solution to counterbalance the increased pressure is to
enlarge the supra-glottal cavity by advancing the root of the tongue. It
has been repeatedly observed that the tongue root is in a more front
position in voiced stops compared to voiceless stops
\citep{kent1969, perkell1969, westbury1983}.

However, the relationship between tongue root advancement and voicing is
a complex one. First, tongue root advancement is not the only mechanism
for \ldots{} and it is somewhat idiosyncratic. Second, tongue root
advancement seems to be decoupled from the presence of actual vocal fold
vibration. \citet{ahn2015}; \citet{ahn2016} find that \ldots{}

In an exploratory study of the link between voicing and vowel duration,
\citet{coretta2018f}; \citet{coretta2018d} finds that the advancing
gesture of the tongue root is initiated at around 50\% into the duration
of vowel in Italian and Polish. This finding agrees with
\citet{rothenberg1967}, who argues that a ballistic forward movement of
the tongue root would require between 70 and 90 milliseconds to reach
completion. Given that stop closures are generally much shorter than
that, it is natural that advancement is initiated during the vowel, so
that an appreciable amount of advancement is obtained when closure is
achieved. Moreover, the advancing gesture in the Italian and Polish data
is present in vowels before both voiced and voiceless stops, which is
unexpected given that tongue root advancement is generally considered to
be a feature of voiced sounds. The presence of an advancing
gesture---relative to the position of the root at the onset of the
vowel---in voiceless stops could be a mechanical consequence of tongue
body raising.

The place of articulation of the consonant and the vowel type also have
an effect on tongue root advancement. Voiced labial stops do not
generally show tongue root advancement but rather tongue body lowering
{[}{]}. Tongue body lowering, however, is also a general property of
labial stops (whether voiced or not), such that during the production of
labial stops, the tongue body lowers relative to the preceding and
following vocalic segment, phenomenon known as the trough effect.
