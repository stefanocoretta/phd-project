# Introduction

One of the known differences in the supra-glottal articulation of voiced and voiceless consonants concerns the position of the tongue root relative to the antero-posterior plane.
It has been observed that the tongue root is in a more front position in voiced stops than in voiceless stops \citep{kent1969,perkell1969,westbury1983}.
This gesture has been interpreted as a mechanism to ensure voicing during closure.
The realisation of vocal fold vibration (i.e. voicing) requires the air pressure in the supra-glottal cavity to be lower than the air pressure below the glottis.
During the production of voiced obstruents, the supra-glottal pressure quickly increases.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to maintain voicing during closure, to the point that voicing can cease if the supra-glottal pressure is higher than the sub-glottal pressure [@ohala2011].
An articulatory solution to counterbalance the increase in pressure is to expand the supra-glottal cavity by advancing the root of the tongue.
The ability to lower the supra-glottal air pressure by advancing the tongue root is put to a different use in Korean, where it facilitates the maintenance of short lag VOT in tense stops [@ahn2016].
