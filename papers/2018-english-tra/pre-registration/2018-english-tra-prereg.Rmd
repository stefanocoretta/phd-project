# Study information

## Title



## Authorship

Stefano Coretta (The University of Manchester, UK), Steven M. Lulich (Indiana University, USA).

## Research questions

An exploratory study of articulatory properties of link between consonant voicing and vowel duration [@coretta2018f; @coretta2018d] showed that tongue root advancement is initiated during the production of vowels preceding both voiced and voiceless stops in Italian and Polish.
@coretta2018d proposes that root advancement might have originally been a mechanical consequence of tongue body raising, then evolutionarily coopted for cavity enlargement in the context of voiced stops.

The following research questions derive from the cooptation hypothesis:

1. Is the time of the onset of the tongue root advancement gesture identical to that of the onset of the tongue body raising gesture?
2. What is the relationship of timing and velocity of the advancing gesture in voiceless and voiced stop contexts?
3. Do labial stops have tongue root advancement, both voiced and voiceless?
<!-- maybe it should be tongue body lowering rather? -->

## Hypotheses


# Sampling plan

## Existing data



## Explanation of existing data



## Data collection procedures

### Participants

Inclusion rule: Native speakers of American English, 18+ yo, with no reported hearing or speaking disorders, with normal or corrected to normal vision.

### Procedure

The words are embedded in the frame sentence *I say a X again*.

## Sample size

20 participants, 8 words, 10 repetitions.
Grand total: 1600 observations.

## Sample size rationale

There is a general consensus in ultrasound tongue imaging studies that a number of participants between 10 and 20 is acceptable, given the time resources necessary for processing the data.


## Stopping rule

Data collection will be terminated if the 20 participants target is not reached by the October 29th 2018.

# Variables

## Manipulated variables
\label{s:manipulated}

* **Place of articulation**: velar (/k, g/), labial (/p, b/)
* **Voicing**: voiceless (/k, p/), voiced (/g, b/)

The word stimuli:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
pop & pob  \\
caulk & cog \\
popper & pobber \\
cocker & cogger \\
\end{tabular}

## Measured variables

* **Tongue root displacement** (TRD)
* **Tongue body displacement** (TBD)
* **Gesture onset of tongue root advancement** (TR-GONS)
* **Gesture onset of tongue body raising** (TB-GONS)
* **Maximum displacement of tongue body raising** (TB-MAX)
* **TB-MAX to TR/TB-GONS**
* **TRA velocity**

## Indices

NA.

# Design plan

## Study type

Experiment---A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.

## Blinding

No blinding is involved in this study.

## Study design

Repeated measures, mixed design.

## Randomisation

The word stimuli will be randomised across each block and across speakers.

# Analysis plan

## Statistical models
\label{s:stats}

Five statistical models will be fit to test the hypothesis in ...

1. A generalised additive mixed model with tongue root

## Transformations

NA.

## Follow-up analyses

NA.

## Inference criteria

*P*-values will be used for the effect of vowel height on vowel duration, VOT, and RVoffT, with $\alpha$ = 0.05.
*P*-values below 0.05 will be deemed significant.
Bayes factors will be employed for the effect of vowel height on voicing interval duration, since I am interested in testing both the null and the alternative hypotheses.
The recommendations in \citet[139]{raftery1995} for the interpretation of the Bayes factors will be followed.

## Data exclusion


## Missing data

NA.
