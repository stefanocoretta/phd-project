# Study information

## Title



## Authorship

Stefano Coretta (The University of Manchester, UK), Steven M. Lulich (Indiana University, USA).

## Research questions

An exploratory study of articulatory properties of link between consonant voicing and vowel duration [@coretta2018f; @coretta2018d] showed that tongue root advancement is initiated during the production of vowels preceding both voiced and voiceless stops in Italian and Polish.
@coretta2018d proposes that root advancement might have originally been a mechanical consequence of tongue body raising, then evolutionarily coopted for cavity enlargement in the context of voiced stops.

The following research questions derive from the cooptation hypothesis:

1. Is the time of the onset of the tongue root advancement gesture identical to that of the onset of the tongue body raising gesture?
2. What is the relationship of timing and velocity of the advancing gesture in voiceless and voiced stop contexts?
3. Do labial stops have tongue root advancement, both voiced and voiceless?
<!-- maybe it should be tongue body lowering rather? -->

## Hypotheses


# Sampling plan

## Existing data

**Registration prior to creation of data**: As of the date of submission of this research plan for preregistration, the data have not yet been collected, created, or realised.

## Explanation of existing data



## Data collection procedures

### Participants

Inclusion rule: Native speakers of American English, 18+ yo, with no reported hearing or speaking disorders, with normal or corrected to normal vision.

### Procedure



## Sample size

20 participants, 8 words, 10 repetitions.
Grand total: 1600 observations.

## Sample size rationale

@brysbaert2018 suggest to have around 1600 observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli).


## Stopping rule

Data collection will be terminated if the 20 participants target is not reached by the October 29th 2018.

# Variables

## Manipulated variables
\label{s:manipulated}


## Measured variables


## Indices

NA.

# Design plan

## Study type

Experiment---A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.

## Blinding

No blinding is involved in this study.

## Study design

Repeated measures, mixed design.

## Randomisation



# Analysis plan

## Statistical models
\label{s:stats}



## Transformations

NA.

## Follow-up analyses

NA.

## Inference criteria

*P*-values will be used for the effect of vowel height on vowel duration, VOT, and RVoffT, with $\alpha$ = 0.05.
*P*-values below 0.05 will be deemed significant.
Bayes factors will be employed for the effect of vowel height on voicing interval duration, since I am interested in testing both the null and the alternative hypotheses.
The recommendations in \citet[139]{raftery1995} for the interpretation of the Bayes factors will be followed.

## Data exclusion

Tokens in which the consonant closure is entirely voiced will be excluded.

## Missing data

NA.

## Exploratory analysis

An exploratory analysis will assess the effect of vowel identity and the interaction between vowel height and vowel backness on vowel duration, voicing duration, RVoffT.
Also, the effects of vowel and place of articulation on voicing during closure will be examined.
