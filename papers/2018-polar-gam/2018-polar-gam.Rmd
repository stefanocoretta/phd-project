# Introduction

<!-- need to say that tongue comes from UTI -->
Since the publication of the seminal paper by @davidson2006, statistical modelling of whole tongue contours has been dominated by the use of Smoothing Splines Analysis of Variance (SSANOVA), which undoubtedly brought a conspicuous advancement for understanding the articulation of speech sounds.
Some of the limitations of modelling tongue contours with SSANOVA is that separate models are needed for different phonetic contexts even within a single speaker, and secondly SSANOVA as implemented in most studies does not include random effects (which have been shown to be extremely important XXX).
The general difficulty felt with SSANOVA and tongue contours has favoured alternative methods like Principal Component Analysis.

On the other hand, developments in the statistical and programming world have seen the emergence of a highly flexible technique, Generalised Additive models (GAMs).
GAMs have being increasingly adopted in linguistics as a means to model dynamic speech data.
Indeed, @soskuthy2017 explicitly suggests the use of GAMs with tongue contours

This paper introduces an implementation of GAMs with tongue contours using polar coordinates.
The use of polar GAMs is illustrated with ultrasound tongue imaging data comparing voiceless and voiced stops.
The R package `rticulate` has been developed to facilitate the use of the model, and it is briefly introduced here.

## Ultrasound tongue imaging

Ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive technique for obtaining an image of internal organs and tissue.
Ultrasound imaging has been successfully used for imaging the mid-sagittal  section of the tongue surface [].
Ultrasound tongue imaging employs a transducer placed in contact with the sub-mental triangle (the area under the chin).
The transducer propagates ultrasonic waves that travel through the aperture of the mandible and get reflected by the air above the tongue surface.
The reflection is then translated into an image which shows the approximate location of the tongue surface.

## Generalised Additive models

Generalised additive modelling is a more general form of non-parametric modelling that allows fitting non-linear as well as linear effects.
Generalised additive models, or GAMs, are built with smoothing splines.
Smoothing splines are also at the heart of SSANOVA.
In GAMs, however, smoothing splines maximise the fit to the data while being constrained by a smoothing penalty estimated from the data itself which prevents overfitting.
GAMs are powerful and flexible models that can deal with non-linear data efficiently.
Moreover, random effects can also be implemented in GAMs, as generalised additive mixed models (or GAMMs).

Tongue contours as extracted from ultrasound imaging can be efficiently model using GAM(M)s.
The random effects part of GAMMs also constitutes an improvement over traditional SSANOVA, which usually implements fixed effects only.
