# Introduction

<!-- need to say that tongue comes from UTI -->
Since the publication of the seminal paper by @davidson2006, statistical modelling of whole tongue contours has been dominated by the use of Smoothing Splines Analysis of Variance (SSANOVA), which undoubtedly brought a conspicuous advancement for understanding the articulation of speech sounds.
Some of the limitations of modelling tongue contours with SSANOVA is that separate models are needed for different phonetic contexts even within a single speaker, and secondly SSANOVA as implemented in most studies does not include random effects (which have been shown to be extremely important XXX).
The general difficulty felt with SSANOVA and tongue contours has favoured alternative methods like Principal Component Analysis.

On the other hand, developments in the statistical and programming world have seen the emergence of a highly flexible technique, Generalised Additive models (GAMs).
GAMs have being increasingly adopted in linguistics as a means to model dynamic speech data.
Indeed, @soskuthy2017 explicitly suggests the use of GAMs with tongue contours

This paper introduces an implementation of GAMs with tongue contours using polar coordinates.
The use of polar GAMs is illustrated with ultrasound tongue imaging data comparing voiceless and voiced stops.
The R package `rticulate` has been developed to facilitate the use of the model, and it is briefly introduced here.
