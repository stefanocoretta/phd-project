# Introduction

# Methodology

## Participants

Native speakers of Italian and Polish have been recruited in Manchester and in Italy.
Four speakers per language participated in the experiment.
The participants recieved a compensation of £10 (or Euro equivalent).

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, and C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/ (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/, etc.).
All possible combinations were employed, yelding to a total of 12 target words.
The words were embedded in a frame sentence in medial position.
Prosodically similar sentences were used to ensure comparability between languages.
The frame sentence was *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' for Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish.

## Equipment set-up

An Articulate Instruments set-up was used for this study.
This is constituted by a TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer plugged into a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit.
A synchronisation unit (P-Stretch) was plugged into the Echo Blaster unit and used for automatic audio/ultrasound synchronisation.
A Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone plugged into a ... was used for audio recording.
Articulate Assistant Advanced v2.17.1 running on a Windows laptop was used for the acquisition of audio and ultrasonic signal.

## Procedure

The stimuli were randomised for each participant and repeated six times (the random order was kept the same in each of the six repetitions due to software constraints).
