# Introduction

It is known that tongue root plays a role in maintainng voicing in voiced stops in English.
Recent ultrasound tongue imaging work has confirmed that the tongue root is advanced in voiced consonants.
Tongue root advancement has been shown to be present also when vocal fold vibration is not present [@ahn2016].
An interesting question arising from this is weather tongue root advancement might be correlated to other factors like, the focus of this paper, vowel duration.
Several studies showed that vowels followed by voiced stops are longer than vowels followed by voiceless stops.
Different languages show different magnitudes of such durational differential and some languages do not show it at all.
Given the connection between voicing and tongue root advancement, it is natural to ask whether tongue root advancement is also linked to vowel duration.
If this is indeed the case, then one would expect tongue root advancemnt to play a role in language that have the voicing effect, but not in languages that do not show it.

To test this hypothesis, I conducted an acoustic and articulatory study that looked at vowel duration and tongue contours to assess the possible link between consonantal and vocalic tongue gestures.

Although several attempts have been put forward to explain the effect of voicing on vowel durations, to date no consensus has been reached.
A recurrent theme focusses on the difference in gestural implementation that characterises voiced stops in comparison with voiceless stops.\footnote{However, see ... for a perceptually inclined account.}
One of the first accounts that attributed the voicing effect to a difference in production is that of @halle1967, subsequently reiterated by @chomsky1968.
According to this account, voicing in vowels is produced with a state of the glottis that diverges from the configuration necessary to produce voiced consonants, due to the aerodynamics of the vocal tract.
On the contrary, it is claimed that voiceless stops do not require any specific glottal configuration and thus the voicing perpetuaded during the vowel naturally ceases at closure.
The authors thus hypothesise that, to allow the glottal state to change in voiced stops from sonorant voicing to obstruent voicing, the vowel is lengthen so that enough time is available for the change to happen without compromising the quality of voicing during the vowel.
Although such account seemed promising at that time, later studies could not demonstrate that obstruent voicing is any different from sonorant voicing.

Tongue root advancement differences seems like a promising area of enquiry since its link to voicing has been already confirmed.
On the same line of the laryngeal hypothesis, I put forward a similar account in which it is tongue root advancement rather than fold configuration that requires extra time during the vowel to be implemented.
If tongue root advancement plays a role in determining the duration of preceding vowels through the extension mechanism described before, than one expects languages with the voicing effect to show a systematic advancement of the tongue root in voiced stops.
On the contrary, tongue root advancement in languages without the voicing effect should be absent or less systematic.



# Methodology

## Participants

Native speakers of Italian and Polish have been recruited in Manchester and in Italy.
Four speakers per language participated in the experiment.
The participants recieved a compensation of £10 (or Euro equivalent).

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, and C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/ (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/, etc.).
All possible combinations were employed, yelding to a total of 12 target words.
The words were embedded in a frame sentence in medial position.
Prosodically similar sentences were used to ensure comparability between languages.
The frame sentence was *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' for Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish.

## Equipment set-up

An Articulate Instruments set-up was used for this study.
This is constituted by a TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer plugged into a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit.
A synchronisation unit (P-Stretch) was plugged into the Echo Blaster unit and used for automatic audio/ultrasound synchronisation.
A Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone plugged into a ... was used for audio recording.
Articulate Assistant Advanced v2.17.1 running on a Windows laptop was used for the acquisition of audio and ultrasonic signal.
A stabilisation headset produced by Articulate Instruments was used for probe stabilisation [].

## Procedure

The stimuli were randomised for each participant and repeated six times (the order was kept the same in each of the six repetitions due to software constraints).
Before recording the stimuli, the occlusal plane of the participant was imaged using a bite plate (), and the palate asking the participant to swallow water.

## Analysis

The spline data was normalised within speaker by coordinate offsetting and rotation based on the occlusal plane.
Generalised additive mixed effects models (GAMM) were used for statistical analysis in R [@r-core-team2017].
