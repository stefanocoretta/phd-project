# Introduction

It is known that the root of the tongue can play a role in maintaining voicing during the closure of voiced obstruents.
The production of vocal fold vibration requires a pressure differential between the sub-glottal and the supra-glottal cavities (with lower pressure in the supra-glottal cavity).
During the production of voiced obstruents, the pressure in the supra-glottal cavity quickly increases, due to the additional air injected from the lungs in the supra-glottal cavity, which is completely sealed in obstruent consonants.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to maintain voicing during closure, at the point that voicing can stop if the lowest threshold of pressure differential is reached and surpassed.
@westbury1983 argued that one way to counterbalance the pressure increase in the supra-glottal cavity is to enlarge the cavity through expansion of the pharyngeal walls.
One way to achieve this is to advance the root of the tongue.
@ahn2016 has recently has demonstrated, drawing from ultrasound tongue imaging, that the root of the tongue is advanced during the articulation of voiced consonants in American English.
She also showed that tongue root advancement is present even when vocal fold vibration is not present during closure in underlyingly voiced stops.
An interesting question arising from the connection between voicing and tongue root is weather the advancement of the root is correlated with other phonetic characteristics, like the duration of vowels preceding obstruents.

An extensive pool of studies showed that vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents and shorter when followed by voiceless obstruents [@house1953; @chen1970; @klatt1973; @lisker1973].
Most of the literature on the topic suggests that different languages show different magnitudes of such durational differential, and that in some other languages the duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following obstruent.\footnote{For a different opinion on the first matter, see @laeufer1992.}
Although several attempts have been put forward to explain the effect of voicing on vowel durations, no consensus has been reached to date.
Nonetheless, a recurrent theme focusses on the differences that characterise the gestural implementation of voiced and voiceless stops.\footnote{However, see \citep{javkin1976} and \cite{kluender1988} for two perceptually inclined proposals.}
One of the earliest articulatory accounts of the voicing effect attributed the difference in vowel duration to the divergent configuration of the vocal folds in sonorant and obstruent voicing [@halle1967; reiterated in @chomsky1968].
According to @halle1967, voicing in obstruents is produced with a state of the glottis that is different from the configuration necessary to produce vocal fold vibration in sonorants like vowels.
On the contrary, they claim that voiceless stops do not require any specific glottal configuration and thus the voicing perpetuated during the vowel can just naturally ceases at closure (or a few milliseconds after it).
The authors thus hypothesise that, to allow the glottal state to change from sonorant voicing to obstruent voicing, the vowel is lengthen so that enough time is available for the change to happen.

Although such account seemed promising at the time it was proposed, later studies failed to demonstrate that obstruent voicing is any different from sonorant voicing [].
Given the established connection between voicing and tongue root advancement, the hypothesis follows that tongue root advancement could also be linked to vowel duration.
If this were the case, a language in which vowels have different durations depending on the voicing of the following consonant should also show tongue root advancement in voiced stops, while in those languages in which vowel durations are not affected by voicing, tongue root advancement should not be employed.
On the same line of the hypothesis in @halle1967, I put forward an account in which a more complex tongue gesture in voiced consonants requires a longer time to be achieved.
A possible solution to allow for this additional time is to maintain the vocalic gesture for a prolonged time (as in the @halle1967 hypothesis).
If tongue root advancement plays a role in determining the duration of preceding vowels through such extension mechanism, than it is expected that languages with the voicing effect show a systematic advancement of the tongue root in voiced stops.

In a study assessing general properties on segmental durations of spoken Italian, @farnetani1986 found that the first vowel in /lada/ was on average 35 msec longer than the vowel in /lata/ (/lata/ 223 msec, sd = 18; /lada/ 258 msec, sd = 13, p. 26).
@esposito2002 extended Farnetanis's research to all vowels and stops and found that vowels were longer when followed by a voiced stop, with an estimate similar to what reported in @farnetani1986.
<!-- Add two papers that will come through document supply -->
Vowels in Polish, on the other hand, are not affected by the voicing of the following consonant, according to @keating1984.
Italian and Polish have been chosen as the two test languages for this study.

<!-- actually it's Keating 1979 PhD dissertation -->
<!-- The duration of vowels n in the word pair /rata/ ~ /rada/ and found that there was a durational difference of 2 milliseconds.
As for the some of the Italian studies, statistical analysis was not performed, although judging by the size of the difference, it can be assumed that it is not significant. -->

# Methodology

## Participants

Four native speakers for each of Italian and Polish have been recruited on a volunteering basis in Manchester and in Italy.
This research has obtained ethic clearance by the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76).
The participants received a monetary compensation of £10/10€.

## Equipment set-up

\caption{Schematic representation of the equipment setup
(\citealt{articulate2011}, se text for details).\label{f:uti-setup}}
\end{figure*}

An Articulate Instruments Inc. set-up was used for this study (\Cref{f:uti-setup}).
This is constituted by a TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 (20mm radius, 2-4 MHz) ultrasonic transducer plugged into a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit.
A synchronisation unit (P-Stretch) was plugged into the Echo Blaster unit and used for automatic audio/ultrasound synchronisation.
A Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone plugged into a FocusRight pre-amplifier was used for audio recording.
Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA) v2.17.2 running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows 7 was used for the acquisition of the audio and ultrasonic signals.
Stabilisation of the ultrasound probe was ensured by using the stabilisation headset produced by Articulate Instruments Inc.

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, and C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/ (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/, etc.).
A bilabial stop /p/ was chosen as the first consonant to reduce influence on the following vowel (although cf. @vazquez-alvarez2007).
Only coronal and velar stops were used as target consonants since labial consonants cannot be imaged with ultrasonography.
All possible combinations were employed, yielding to a total of 12 target words.
The words were embedded in medial position within a frame sentence.
Prosodically similar sentences were used to ensure comparability between languages.
The frame sentence was *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' for Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish.

## Procedure

The stimuli were randomised for each participant, but the order was kept the same within participant due to software constraints.
Each participant repeated the list of randomised stimuli six times.
The participants' occlusal plane was obtained using a bite plate, and the hard palate was imaged by asking the participant to swallow water [@scobbie2011].
The frame rate of the acquisition of the ultrasonic data varied between 55 and 65 frames per second (one frame every 18-15 milliseconds).
The audio signal was recorded at 22050 MHz, 16-bit.

## Data processing

Synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signal was achieved in post-processing, using the built-in procedure in AAA.
The data were then subjected to force alignment using the SPASS force aligner [@bigi2015].
The outcome of the automatic annotation was then manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.
The onset of the target consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected automatically employing a Praat implementation of the algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.
The duration of the following intervals was then extracted from the acoustic landmarks using an automated procedure in Praat: vowel duration (V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant duration (V2 offset to C2 offset), closure duration (V2 offset to C2 burst).

<!--
The outcome of the automatic annotation was then manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.: the target vowel onset (V1 onset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of appearance of higher formants in the spectrogram following the burst of /p/ (C1); the target vowel offset (V1 offset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of disappearance of the higher formants in the spectrogram; this point also coincides with the consonant onset (C2 onset) and the closure onset (C2 closure onset); consonant offset (C2 offset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of formants onsets of the following vowel.
The onset of the consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected automatically employing a Praat implementation of the algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.

Tongue contours were extracted from the ultrasonic data using Articulate Assistant Advanced [AAA, @articulate2011].
Spline lines were first fitted to the visible contours using the batch tracking function natively included in AAA.
Manual correction was applied in the cases where the automatic tracking showed clear errors.
Tongue displacement along time was thus calculated in AAA using a custom module provided by Dr. Patrycja Strycharczuk [@Strycharczuk2015].
The displacement was calculated based on the movement of the splines along a given fan line.
For each speaker, two relevant fan lines were chosen: one for the tongue tip and one for the tongue dorsum.
The selection of the fan lines was based on the inspection of the standard deviation of the splines in the relevant area of the tongue.
The fan line that showed the highest standard deviation was then chosen as the relevant fan line for the calculation of displacement.
Velocity and tangential velocity were also calculated.
The time of maximum displacement based on tangential velocity was finally obtained using a modified version of a search set-up provided by Dr. Patrycja Strycharczuk.
<!-- change to "both the x and y were provided by Dr." -->

## Analysis

The coordinates of the splines were exported at acoustic closure and at maximum displacement.
The contours were normalised by applying offsetting and rotation relative to the participant’s occlusal plane [@scobbie2011].
Generalised additive mixed effects models [@wood2006] were used for the statistical analysis of tongue contour data in R [@r-core-team2017].
Duration measurements were subject to linear mixed effects models using `lme4` in R [@bates2015].

# Results

## Vowel duration and voicing

A linear mixed effect regression model was fit on the Italian vowel durations with duration as the outcome variable, vowel quality (/a, o, u/), voicing and place of articulation of the following consonant, sentence duration as fixed effects, random intercepts by speaker and word, and random slopes for voicing by speaker.
An interaction between voicing and vowel quality was also included, which turned out to be significant.
P-values were obtained through likelihood ration tests comparing a model including voicing with a null model without voicing.
According to the model, Italian vowels are 19.5 msec (±5.5) longer if followed by a voiced stop ($\chi^2$(3) = 18.5, p = 0.000337).

For Polish, the same model structure was used, excluding the voicing-vowel interaction (which was not significant).
Surprisingly, the model reported a partially significant 8 msec (±3) effect of consonantal voicing on the preceding vowel ($\chi^2$(1) = 5.4, p = 0.02).
The exploration of the random slopes by speaker showed that one speaker showed a particularly higher slope for voicing, meaning that the effect of voicing was stronger in his data.
This observation will come handy while discussing about the results of the tongue contour data.

## Tongue contours

The Italian tongue contour analysis showed that voiced stops are produced with advancement of the root of the tongue.
Generalised additive mixed effect models were fitted for each speaker: the y-coordinates of the contours were the outcome variable; the x-coordinates the parametric term; a reference smooth term for X, with difference smooths for X by voicing, vowel quality, and place of articulation of following consonant; random smooths by word.
A first-order autoregressive model was included, given the high auto-correlation residuals as obtained by visual inspection of the residuals.
For two participants out of four, the root was significantly more front in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts (/a, o/).
On the other hand, one participant had significant tongue root advancement only following /a/, while the fourth participant didn't show advancement at all.
For Polish, three out of four speakers did not have tongue root advancement, while the fourth speaker showed significant advancement in both vocalic contexts.

Further contour analysis was carried out at the point of acoustic closure for Italian and for the Polish speaker showing advancement.
Surprisingly, the tongue root in the voiced condition was found to be already in advanced position at closure.
Both the Italian (4 speakers) and the Polish data (1 speaker) show that the root of the tongue at the time of consonantal closure is advanced in both languages.
Models fitted on the individual speakers comparing tongue contours at closure and at maximum displacement further confirmed that root advancement was bigger at maximum displacement for Italian, but not for Polish.

# Discussion

The presence of tongue root advancement in Italian but not in Polish initially supports the idea that vowels are longer if followed by voiced stops to allow time for the root to reach a position suitable for consonantal voicing.
The reported absence of the voicing effect in Polish could then be ascribed to the absence of tongue root advancement in the voiced consonants of Polish.
However, such statement is complicated by two facts that emerged from the data analysed in this study.
First, tongue root advancement was found in one of the Polish speakers and it was absent from one of the Italian speakers.
Second, even though the effect was not as big as for Italian, the Polish duration data nonetheless showed a difference of 8 msec.
However, as mentioned above, one Polish speaker had a particularly higher slope for voicing, and incidentally this is also the same and only Polish speaker who showed root advancement.
Moreover, a difference of 8 milliseconds could be considered to be quite small in any case, although statistically detectable.\footnote{A model fitted on the data excluding the outlier speaker leads in fact to a smaller estimate of about 6 msec.}

The data also showed raising of the tongue dorsum concomitant to the advancement of the root.
Although such gesture was not prospected on the basis of the tested hypothesis, it makes sense from an anatomical stand point.
Given the anteriorisation of the tongue root, other things being equal, it derives that the tongue mass gets compressed.
Such compression can be counterbalanced (entirely or partially) by allowing the dorsum of the tongue to raise.
It is not thus surprising to observe a raised dorsum in voiced stops accompanying root advancement.
