# Introduction

It is known that the root of the tongue can play a role in maintaining voicing during the closure of voiced stop consonants.
The production of vocal fold vibration requires a pressure differential between the sub-glottal and the supra-glottal cavities (with lower pressure in the supra-glottal cavity).
During the production of voiced obstruents, the pressure in the supra-glottal cavity quickly increases, due to the additional air injected from the lungs in the supra-glottal cavity, which is completely sealed in stops.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to maintain voicing during closure, at the point that voicing can stop if the lowest threshold of pressure differential is reached and surpassed.

@westbury1983 argued that one way to counterbalance the pressure increase in the supra-glottal cavity is to enlarge the cavity through expansion of the pharyngeal walls.
One way to achieve this is to advance the root of the tongue.
@ahn2016 have recently demonstrated, drawing from ultrasound tongue imaging, that the root of the tongue is advanced during the articulation of voiced consonants in American English.
They also showed that tongue root advancement is present even when vocal fold vibration is not implemented during closure in underlyingly voiced stops.
An interesting question arising from the connection between voicing and tongue root is weather the advancement of the root is correlated with other phonetic characteristics, like the duration of vowels preceding stops.

An extensive pool of studies showed that vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents and shorter when followed by voiceless obstruents [@house1953; @chen1970; @klatt1973; @lisker1973, just to mention a few].
Most of the literature on the topic suggests that different languages show different magnitudes of such durational differential, and that in some other languages the duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following obstruent.\footnote{For a different opinion on the first matter, see \citet{laeufer1992}.}
Although several attempts have been put forward to explain the effect of voicing on vowel durations, no consensus has been reached to date.
Nonetheless, a recurrent theme focusses on the differences that characterise the gestural implementation of voiced and voiceless stops.\footnote{However, see \citep{javkin1976} and \cite{kluender1988} for two perceptually inclined proposals.}

One of the earliest articulatory accounts of the voicing effect attributed the difference in vowel duration to the divergent configuration of the vocal folds in sonorant and obstruent voicing [@halle1967; reiterated in @chomsky1968].
According to @halle1967, voicing in obstruents is produced with a state of the glottis that is different from the configuration necessary to produce vocal fold vibration in sonorants like vowels.
On the contrary, they claim that voiceless stops do not require any specific glottal configuration and thus the voicing perpetuated during the vowel can just naturally ceases at closure (or a few milliseconds after it).
The authors thus hypothesise that, to allow the glottal state to change from sonorant voicing to obstruent voicing, the vowel is lengthen so that enough time is available for the adjustments to happen.

Although such account seemed promising at the time it was proposed, later studies failed to demonstrate that obstruent voicing is any different from sonorant voicing [].
Given the established connection between voicing and tongue root advancement, the hypothesis follows that tongue root advancement could also be linked to vowel duration.
If this were the case, a language in which vowels have different durations depending on the voicing of the following consonant should also show tongue root advancement in voiced stops, while tongue root advancement should not be employed in those languages in which vowel durations are not affected by voicing.
On the same line of the hypothesis in @halle1967, I put forward an account in which a more complex tongue gesture in voiced consonants requires a longer time to be achieved.
A possible solution to allow for this additional time is to maintain the vocalic gesture for a prolonged time.
If tongue root advancement plays a role in determining the duration of preceding vowels through such mechanism, than it is expected that languages with the voicing effect should show a systematic advancement of the tongue root in voiced stops.

In a study assessing general properties on segmental durations of spoken Italian, @farnetani1986 found that the first vowel in /lada/ was on average 35 msec longer than the vowel in /lata/ (/lata/ 223 msec, sd = 18; /lada/ 258 msec, sd = 13, p. 26).
@esposito2002 extended Farnetanis's research to all vowels and stops and found that vowels were longer when followed by a voiced stop, with an estimate similar to what reported in @farnetani1986.
<!-- Add two papers that will come through document supply -->
Vowels in Polish, on the other hand, are not affected by the voicing of the following consonant, according to @keating1984.
For these reasons, Italian and Polish have been chosen as the two test languages for this study.

<!-- actually it's Keating 1979 PhD dissertation -->
<!-- The duration of vowels n in the word pair /rata/ ~ /rada/ and found that there was a durational difference of 2 milliseconds.
As for the some of the Italian studies, statistical analysis was not performed, although judging by the size of the difference, it can be assumed that it is not significant. -->

Eight native speakers of Italian (2 females, 2 males) and Polish (2 females, 2 males) have been recorded in Manchester and in Italy (\Cref{t:participants}).
The Italian speakers were from Northern Italy (three from the Northwest and one from Northeast).
The Polish group was more heterogeneous, with two speakers from Poznań, one from Przasnysz, and one from Warsaw.
This research has obtained ethic clearance from the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76).
The participants received a small monetary compensation.

## Equipment set-up

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{../../graphics/uti-setup.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic representation of the equipment setup (\citealt{articulate2011}, see text for details).}
    \label{f:uti-setup}
\end{figure*}

An Articulate Instruments Inc. set-up was used for this study (\Cref{f:uti-setup}).
This was constituted by a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit with a TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer (20mm radius, 2-4 MHz).
A synchronisation unit (P-Stretch) was plugged into the Echo Blaster unit and used for automatic audio/ultrasound synchronisation.
A FocusRight pre-amplifier and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used for audio recording.
The acquisition of the ultrasonic and audio signals was achieved with the software Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA, v2.17.2) running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows 7.
Stabilisation of the ultrasonic transducer was ensured by using a stabilisation headset produced by Articulate Instruments Inc. (not shown in the figure).

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} = V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/, etc.), yielding a total of 12 target words.
A labial stop was chosen as the first consonant to reduce influence on the following vowel (although cf. \citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007}).
Only coronal and velar stops were used as target consonants since labial consonants cannot be imaged with ultrasonography.
The target words were embedded in a frame sentence.
Prosodically similar sentences were used to ensure comparability between languages.
The frame sentence was *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' for Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish.

## Procedure

The sentences with the target words were randomised for each participant, although the order was kept the same between repetitions within participant due to software constraints.
Each participant repeated the list of randomised stimuli six times.
The participant's occlusal plane was obtained using a bite plate, and the hard palate was imaged by asking the participant to swallow water [@scobbie2011].
The frame rate of the acquisition of the ultrasonic data varied between 55 and 65 frames per second (one frame every 15-18 milliseconds).
The audio signal was recorded at 22050 MHz (16-bit).

## Data processing

Synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signal was achieved in post-processing, using a built-in procedure of AAA.
The data were then subject to force alignment using the SPPAS force aligner [@bigi2015].
The outcome of the automatic annotation was then manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.
The onset of the target consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected automatically in Praat [@boersma2016], employing a implementation of the algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.
The durations of the following intervals were then extracted from the acoustic landmarks using an automated procedure in Praat: vowel duration (V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant duration (V1 offset to V2 onset), and closure duration (V1 offset to C2 burst).

Tongue contours were extracted from the ultrasonic data using AAA.
Spline curves were first fitted to the visible contours using the AAA batch tracking function.
Manual correction was applied in those cases that showed clear tracking errors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement within consonant closure was then calculated in AAA following the method in @strycharczuk2015.
<!-- The displacement was calculated based on the movement of the splines along one of the 42 fan lines. -->
<!-- For each speaker, two relevant fan lines were chosen: one for the tongue tip and one for the tongue dorsum. -->
Fan line selection in this study was achieved by finding the fan line within the relevant area of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for velar consonants) with the highest standard deviation of displacement.
<!-- on the inspection of the standard deviation of the splines in the relevant area of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for velar consonants).
The fan line that showed the highest standard deviation within the relevant area was used for calculating displacement.
Tongue displacement velocity and tangential velocity were then derived.
The time of maximum displacement was finally obtained from tangential velocity [@strycharczuk2015]. -->

## Analysis

The tongue contours coordinates were exported at two time points: (1) at the onset of C2 closure, and (2) at maximum tongue displacement (within C2 closure).
The contours were normalised by applying offsetting and rotation relative to the participant’s occlusal plane [@scobbie2011].
Generalised additive mixed effects regression models [GAMMs, @wood2006] were used for the statistical analysis of tongue contour data in R [@r-core-team2017].
Duration measurements were subject to linear mixed effects models using `lme4` in R [@bates2015].

# Results

## Vowel duration and voicing

A linear mixed effects regression model was fitted on the Italian vowel duration data with \textsc{duration} as the outcome variable; \textsc{vowel quality} (/a, o, u/), \textsc{voicing} and \textsc{place of articulation} of the following consonant, \textsc{sentence duration} as fixed effects; random intercepts by speaker and word, and by-speaker random slopes for voicing.
An interaction between voicing and vowel quality was also included in the final model, since it significantly improved the model.
P-values were obtained through likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model including voicing with a null model without voicing as a predictor.
According to the full model, Italian vowels are 19.5 milliseconds (±5.5 standard errors) longer if followed by a voiced stop ($\chi^2$(3) = 18.5, p = 0.000337).

For Polish, the same model structure was used, excluding the voicing-vowel interaction (which was not significant).
Surprisingly, the model reported a partially significant 8 milliseconds (±3 standard errors) effect of consonantal voicing on the preceding vowel ($\chi^2$(1) = 5.4, p = 0.02).
The exploration of the random slopes for each speaker indicated that PL05 showed a particularly higher slope for voicing, meaning that the effect of voicing was stronger in his data.
The estimated effect of voicing on vowel duration for PL05 was 14 milliseconds.
This observation will come handy when discussing about the results of the tongue contour data.

## Tongue contours

    \caption{Comparison of tongue contours at maximum tongue displacement (within C2 closure) in Italian (top half) and Polish (bottom half). The plotted contours are reference contours for the coronal consonants preceded by /a/. See text for more details.}
    \label{f:tra}
\end{figure*}

Given the poor quality of the ultrasonic data for /u/, this vowel was not included in the statistical analysis.
Significant testing in GAMMs was achieved through model comparison and visual inspection of the difference smooth, as suggested in \citep{soskuthy2017}.
The analysis of the Italian ultrasonic data showed that voiced stops are produced with advancement of the root of the tongue (), as expected based on previous research on English.
Individual GAMMs were fitted for each speaker: the \textsc{y-coordinates} of the contours were included in the model as the outcome variable; the \textsc{x-coordinates} as the only parametric term.
The following smooths were specified: a reference smooth term for the x-coordinates, three difference smooths for the x-coordinates by \textsc{voicing}, \textsc{vowel quality}, and \textsc{place} of articulation of the following consonant respectively, and by-word random smooths.
A first-order autoregressive model was included to correct for the high autocorrelation residuals.

\Cref{f:tra} (top half) shows the predicted tongue contours in voiceless (red) and voiced stops (blue) at maximum tongue displacement for each Italian speaker.
Below each tongue contour panel, the difference smooth for voicing is also shown (black line, confidence interval in grey).
Tongue contours are significantly different in those point in which the confidence interval of the difference smooth does not include 0 on the ordinate axis.
The significantly different portions of the contours are also indicated in the figures by a shaded red area.

In two participants out of four (IT01, IT02), the root was significantly more front in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts (/a, o/).
On the other hand, one participant (IT03) had significant tongue root advancement only following /a/, while the fourth participant (IT04) didn't show advancement at all.
For Polish (bottom half of \Cref{f:tra}), three out of four speakers (PL02, PL03, PL04) did not have tongue root advancement, while the fourth speaker (PL05) had significant advancement in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts.

Further contour analysis was carried out at C2 closure onset for the Italian and Polish speakers showing advancement.
The tongue root at closure onset was found to be in advanced in voiced consonants ().
<!-- would be interesting to compare closure and maximum with voiceless stops as well, and track displacement through time within vowel -->
<!-- Both the Italian (4 speakers) and the Polish data (1 speaker) show that the root of the tongue at the time of consonantal closure is advanced in both languages. -->
Comparisons of tongue contours at C2 onset and at the time of maximum tongue displacement in voiced consonants further indicated that the degree of root advancement was larger at maximum displacement for the Italian speakers (IT01, IT02, IT03), but not for the Polish speaker (PL05).
\Cref{f:voiced} shows the results for IT01 and PL05 as an example.

# Discussion

Based on the established link between tongue root and voicing, and based on the account by @halle1967, it was hypothesised that the presence of the voicing effect in a language should be correlated with the presence of tongue root advancement, if the latter plays a role in determining the durational differences.
It has been proposed that the additional time required for the tongue to reach an advanced position in voiced stops could be compensated for during the preceding vowel, thus make it longer in comparison with vowels followed by voiceless stops.
To test the correlation hypothesis, ultrasonic data were collected from two languages with and without the voicing effect, Italian and Polish respectively.

The presence of tongue root advancement in Italian but not in Polish provides initial support to the idea that vowels are longer if followed by voiced stops so that enough time is allowed for the root to reach an advanced position, prior to the consonantal closure.
The reported absence of the voicing effect in Polish could then be ascribed to the absence of tongue root advancement in the production of voiced consonants in this language.
However, two complications derive from the data analysed in this study.
First, tongue root advancement was found in one of the Polish speakers (PL05) on one hand and it was absent from one of the Italian speakers (IT04) on the other.
Second, vowels followed by voiced stops in Polish were 8 milliseconds longer in Polish, contrary to what argued in @keating1984.

However, as mentioned above, PL05 had a strikingly higher slope estimate for the effect of voicing on vowel duration, compared to the other speakers, meaning that the voicing effect in his data is stronger and it is probably driving the effect.\footnote{\label{fn:polish-small} However, note that excluding PL05 from the data yielded to an estimate of 6 milliseconds, which would still need to be explained. Given the small magnitude of the effect, it is likely that it arises from the difficulty of segmenting vowel to consonant transitions when the consonant is voiced. Such downside would not apply to the data in PL05 given the larger estimates for the effect of voicing and the random slope, as discussed above.}
Incidentally, PL05 is also the only Polish speaker who produced voiced consonants with an advanced tongue root.
Furthermore, a model comparing tongue root at closure onset versus maximum tongue displacement in PL05 indicated that there was virtually no difference in tongue root advancement at these two time points.
Assuming the effect in the other Polish speakers is small enough to be discarded as an artefact (see \cref{fn:polish-small}), it follows that, independently of the language, the presence of tongue root advancement in voiced stops correlates with a concomitant increased duration in vowels preceding voiced consonants.

Moreover, given the smaller effect of voicing in PL05 compared to the effect in Italian, a potential hypothesis could be that the correlation between tongue root advancement and vowel duration is gradual, rather then categorical.
In this case, even within language it should be possible to see different magnitudes of difference in vowel durations depending on the amount of advancement of the tongue root.
Since the durational difference in the polish speaker PL05 was quite small (14 milliseconds, versus 19.5 milliseconds in Italian), one expects the magnitude of the advancement of the root to be proportionately smaller in this speaker.
Future work will set out to investigate the hypothetically gradual correlation between vowel duration and amount of tongue root advancement.

Finally, the ultrasonic data showed raising of the tongue dorsum concomitant to root advancement.
The presence of such gesture, although not expected, makes sense from an anatomical point of view.
Raising of the tongue body could be implemented as a way to counterbalance the compression of the tongue mass caused by the advancement of the root.
It is not thus surprising to observe a raised tongue body in voiced stops accompanying root advancement.
An alternative account could ascribe tongue body raising to aerodynamic properties of voiced stops.
Since the intra-oral pressure is higher in voiced stops due to the amount of air needed to maintain voicing, a firmer seal at the point of oral constriction could be used to compensate for the increased pressure.
Increasing the area of contact by raising the tongue body would provide for a such firmer constriction.

A possible critique to the account proposed here is that, if an active gesture for maintaining voicing is required during the closure of voiced stops, then it is not clear how the Polish speakers without tongue root advancement can maintain voicing.
However, tongue root advancement is not the only solution: manipulations of the larynx or of the velopharyngeal port, rather than the tongue, can also counterbalance the increasing intra-oral pressure [].
The gestural timing of the larynx and the velopharyngeal port are anatomically independent (although not completely) from the timing of tongue gestures [], and would ideally not require a more complex planning as with an articulatory implementation that requires two gestures operated by the tongue.
