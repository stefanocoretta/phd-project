# Introduction

This paper reports a previously undocumented link between tongue root advancement in the production of voiced stops and longer duration of the preceding vowels.
Using ultrasonic data from speakers of Italian and Polish, I demonstrate that the presence of tongue root advancement correlates with that of the so-called voicing effect, whereby vowels tend to be longer before voiced than before voiceless stops.
I further suggest that such correlation points to a new articulatory account of the differential duration of vowels as a covariate of consonantal voicing.

A considerable number of studies shows that vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents than when they are followed by voiceless obstruents [@house1953;@chen1970;@klatt1973;@lisker1974;@farnetani1986;@fowler1992;@hussein1994;@esposito2002;@lampp2004;@durvasula2012].
This voicing effect has been reported in a variety of languages,
including, but not limited to, English, Hindi, Russian, Italian, and Korean (see \citealt{maddieson1976} for a more comprehensive list).
A common stance in the literature claims that the magnitude of the voicing effect differs depending on the language (although see \citealt{laeufer1992}), and that the duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following obstruents in some languages, like Polish and Czech \citep{keating1984}.
Although several attempts have been made to explain the voicing effect, an account that survives all empirical data is still lacking \citep{durvasula2012}.

To provide a rationale for the language-specificity of the voicing effect, \citet{kluender1988} propose a perceptual origin for the voicing effect.
They argue that speakers actively manipulate vowel durations to enhance the closure-duration difference which cues voicing distinction in obstruents.
<!-- According to another perceptually inclined account, speakers misperceive the voiced portion of the consonant closure of a voiced stop as part of the preceding vowel, which subsequently leads to the production of longer vowel durations before voiced stops \citep{javkin1976}. -->
However, \citet{fowler1992} shows through two perceptual experiments that speakers judge vowels to be longer with increased consonant closure duration, and vice versa that consonant closure is perceived to be longer when vowel duration is increased.
Fowler thus refutes on empirical grounds that speakers exploit durational contrasts to enhance voicing distinctions.
Moreover, \citet{davis1989} demonstrate that closure duration is not a good cue to voicing, which further confutes any account based on closure-duration enhancement.

A plausible account should then satisfy both of the following requirements: (1) it should allow for a language-specific implementation of the voicing effect, and (2) it should place the source of the effect in articulatory properties of voiced or voiceless obstruents that could favour longer or shorter vowels.
One of the first articulatory accounts of the voicing effect is based on differences in glottal adjustments before voiced and voiceless stops (\citealt{halle1967}, reiterated in \citealt{chomsky1968}).
\citep{halle1967} argue that vowels are longer before voiced consonants because more time is needed for the glottis to achieve a position suitable for maintaining voicing during consonant closure.
Later studies, though, established that the glottal configuration of voicing in obstruents does not differ from the one in vowels \citep{lisker1974,kagaya1975}, hence the claim that a glottal adjustment is required in voiced consonants is not supported empirically.

A known articulatory difference between voiced and voiceless consonants regards a supra-glottal ... rather than laryngeal ..., namely the horizontal position of the tongue root.
It has been observed that the tongue root is in a more advanced position in voiced than in voiceless stops \citep{kent1969,perkell1969,westbury1983}.
This has been interpreted as a mechanism to ensure voicing can be maintained during closure.
The realisation of vocal fold vibration (voicing) requires the air pressure of the supra-glottal cavity to be lower than a certain threshold in comparison with the air pressure of the sub-glottal cavity.
During the articulation of voiced obstruents, the supra-glottal pressure quickly increases.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to maintain voicing during closure, to the point that voicing can cease if the pressure cut-off threshold is reached.
An articulatory solution to the counterbalance the increased pressure is to expand the supra-glottal cavity by advancing the root of the tongue.

<!--
It is known that the root of the tongue can play a role in maintaining voicing during the closure of voiced stop consonants \citep{halle1967,kent1969,perkell1969,westbury1983}.
The production of vocal fold vibration requires a pressure differential between the sub-glottal and the supra-glottal cavities (with lower pressure in the supra-glottal cavity).
During the production of voiced obstruents, the pressure in the supra-glottal cavity quickly increases, due to the additional air injected from the lungs in the supra-glottal cavity, which is completely sealed in stops.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to maintain voicing during closure, at the point that voicing can stop if the lowest threshold of pressure differential is reached and surpassed.

@westbury1983 argues that one way to counterbalance the pressure increase in the supra-glottal cavity is to enlarge the cavity through the advancement of the tongue root.
Drawing from ultrasound tongue imaging, @ahn2016 demonstrate that the root of the tongue is advanced during the articulation of voiced consonants in American English.
They also showed that tongue root advancement is present even when vocal fold vibration is not implemented during closure in underlyingly voiced stops.
An interesting question arising from the connection between voicing and tongue root is weather the advancement of the root is correlated with other phonetic characteristics, like the duration of vowels preceding stops.
Such hypothesis will be expanded on in this section, after a brief overview of work on the effect of consonant voicing on vowel duration.

An extensive pool of studies shows that vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents and shorter when followed by voiceless obstruents (\citealt{house1953,chen1970,klatt1973,lisker1973}, just to mention a few).
Most of the literature on this phenomenon, known as the 'voicing effect,' suggests that different languages show different magnitudes of such durational differential, and that in some other languages the duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following obstruent.\footnote{For a different opinion on the first matter, see \citet{laeufer1992}.}
Although several attempts have been put forward to explain the effect of voicing on vowel durations, no consensus has been reached to date.
Nonetheless, a recurrent theme focusses on the differences that characterise the gestural implementation of voiced and voiceless stops.\footnote{However, see \citet{javkin1976} and \citet{kluender1988} for two perceptually inclined proposals.}

One of the earliest articulatory accounts of the voicing effect attributed the difference in vowel duration to the divergent configuration of the vocal folds between voicing in sonorants and in obstruents [@halle1967; reiterated in @chomsky1968].
According to @halle1967, voicing in obstruents is produced with a state of the glottis that is different from the configuration necessary to produce vocal fold vibration in sonorants like vowels.
On the contrary, they claim that voiceless stops do not require any specific glottal configuration and thus the voicing of the preceding vowel can just naturally cease at closure (or a few milliseconds after it).
@halle1967 thus hypothesise that, to allow the glottal state to change from the sonorant voicing of the preceding vowel to obstruent voicing, the vowel is lengthened so that enough time is available for such adjustments to happen.

Although such account seemed promising at the time it was proposed, later studies failed to demonstrate that obstruent voicing is any different from sonorant voicing [].
Given the established connection between voicing and tongue root advancement, the hypothesis follows that tongue root advancement could also be linked to vowel duration.
If this were the case, a language in which vowels have different durations depending on the voicing of the following consonant should also show tongue root advancement in voiced stops, while tongue root advancement should not be employed in those languages in which vowel durations are not affected by voicing.
Building on the hypothesis in @halle1967, I put forward an account in which a relatively more complex tongue gesture in voiced consonants requires a longer time to be achieved (\Cref{s:discussion}).

In this paper, I focus on two languages, Italian and Polish, that have been reported to show and lack the voicing effect respectively.
In a study assessing general properties on segmental durations of spoken Italian, @farnetani1986 shows that the first vowel in /lada/ is on average 35 milliseconds longer than the vowel in /lata/ (/lata/ 223 msec, sd = 18; /lada/ 258 msec, sd = 13, p. 26).
@esposito2002 extends Farnetanis's research to all vowels and stops and demonstrates that vowels are longer when followed by a voiced stop, with an estimate similar to what reported in @farnetani1986.
<!-- Add two papers that will come through document supply -->
<!-- On the other hand, @keating1984 reports that vowels in Polish are not affected by the voicing of the following consonant.
The average duration of the first vowel in /rata/ is 167.5 milliseconds, while the pre-consonantal vowel in /rada/ is just two milliseconds longer.
Based on the hypothesis put forward that there is a link between tongue root advancement and the voicing effect, it is expected that Italian will show tongue root advancement, while Polish will lack such articulatory gesture in the implementation of voiced stops. -->

<!-- actually it's Keating 1979 PhD dissertation -->
<!-- The duration of vowels n in the word pair /rata/ ~ /rada/ and found that there was a durational difference of 2 milliseconds.
As for the some of the Italian studies, statistical analysis was not performed, although judging by the size of the difference, it can be assumed that it is not significant. -->

Eight native speakers of Italian (2 females, 2 males) and Polish (2 females, 2 males) were recorded in Manchester and in Italy (\Cref{t:participants}).
The Italian speakers were from Northern Italy (three from the Northwest and one from Northeast).
The Polish group was more heterogeneous, with two speakers from the North-west (Poznań), and two from the North-east (Warsaw and Przasnysz).
Ethical clearance was obtained for this work from the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76).
The participants received a small monetary compensation.

## Equipment set-up

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{../../graphics/uti-setup.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic representation of the equipment setup (\citealt{articulate2011}, see text for details).}
    \label{f:uti-setup}
\end{figure*}

An Articulate Instruments Ltd™ set-up was used for this study (\Cref{f:uti-setup}).
The ultrasonic data was collected through a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit with a TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer (20mm radius, 2-4 MHz).
A synchronisation unit (P-Stretch) was plugged into the Echo Blaster unit and used for automatic audio/ultrasound synchronisation.
A FocusRight pre-amplifier and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used for audio recording.
The acquisition of the ultrasonic and audio signals was achieved with the software Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA, v2.17.2) running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows 7.
Stabilisation of the ultrasonic transducer was ensured by using a stabilisation headset produced by Articulate Instruments Ltd™ (\citealt{articulate2008}, not shown in figure).

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} = V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/, etc.), yielding a total of 12 target words.
A labial stop was chosen as the first consonant to reduce influence on the following vowel (although see \citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007}).
Only coronal and velar stops were used as target consonants since labial consonants cannot be imaged with ultrasonography.
The target words were embedded in a frame sentence.
Prosodically similar sentences were used to ensure comparability between languages.
The frame sentence was *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' for Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish.

## Procedure

The sentences with the target words were randomised for each participant, although the order was kept the same between repetitions within participant due to software constraints.
Each participant repeated the list of randomised stimuli six times.
A grand total of 576 tokens (288 per language) was recorded.
The participant's occlusal plane was obtained using a bite plate [@scobbie2011], and the hard palate was imaged by asking the participant to swallow water [@epstein2005].
The frame rate of the acquisition of the ultrasonic data ranged between 43 and 68 frames per second.
Other settings varied depending on the frame rate (scanlines = 88-114, pixel per scanline = 980-988, field of view = 71-93, pixel offset = 109-263, depth (mm) = 75-180).
The audio signal was recorded at 22050 MHz (16-bit).

## Data processing and analysis

Synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signal was achieved in post-processing, using a built-in procedure of AAA.
The data were then subject to force alignment using the SPPAS force aligner [@bigi2015].
The outcome of the automatic annotation was then manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.
The onset of the target consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected automatically in Praat [@boersma2016], employing a implementation of the algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.
The durations of the following intervals were extracted from the acoustic landmarks using an automated procedure in Praat: vowel duration (V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant duration (V1 offset to V2 onset), and closure duration (V1 offset to C2 burst).

<!--
The outcome of the automatic annotation was then manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.: the target vowel onset (V1 onset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of appearance of higher formants in the spectrogram following the burst of /p/ (C1); the target vowel offset (V1 offset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of disappearance of the higher formants in the spectrogram; this point also coincides with the consonant onset (C2 onset) and the closure onset (C2 closure onset); consonant offset (C2 offset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of formants onsets of the following vowel.
The onset of the consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected automatically employing a Praat implementation of the algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.

Spline curves were automatically fitted to the visible contours using the AAA batch tracking function.
Manual correction was applied in those cases that showed clear tracking errors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement within consonant closure was then calculated in AAA following the method in @strycharczuk2015.
A fan-like frame consisting of 42 equidistant radial lines was used as the coordinate system.
The origin of the 42 fan-lines coincides with the centre of the ultrasonic probe, such that each fan-line is parallel to the direction of the ultrasonic signal.
Tongue displacement was thus calculated as the displacement of the fitted splines along the fan-line vectors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement was the time of greater displacement along the vector that showed the greatest standard deviation.
The vector search area was restricted to the portion of the splines corresponding to the tongue tip for coronal consonants, and to the portion corresponding to the tongue dorsum for velar consonants.
<!-- The displacement was calculated based on the movement of the splines along one of the 42 fan lines.
Fan line selection in this study was achieved by finding the fan line within the relevant area of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for velar consonants) with the highest standard deviation of displacement.
-->

The cartesian coordinates of the tongue contours were exported from two time points: the onset of C2 closure, and the time maximum tongue displacement (which is always within C2 closure).
The contours were normalised by applying offsetting and rotation relative to the participant’s occlusal plane [@scobbie2011].
<!-- on the inspection of the standard deviation of the splines in the relevant area of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for velar consonants).
The fan line that showed the highest standard deviation within the relevant area was used for calculating displacement.
Tongue displacement velocity and tangential velocity were then derived.
The time of maximum displacement was finally obtained from tangential velocity [@strycharczuk2015]. -->
Durational measurements were analysed with linear mixed effects models using `lme4` in R [@r-core-team2017; @bates2015].
Generalised additive mixed effects regression models [GAMMs, @wood2006] were used for the statistical analysis of tongue contour data.

# Results

## Vowel duration and voicing

A linear mixed effects regression model was fitted to the Italian vowel duration data with \textsc{duration} as the outcome variable; \textsc{vowel quality} (/a, o, u/), \textsc{voicing} and \textsc{place of articulation} of the following consonant, \textsc{sentence duration} as fixed effects; random intercepts by speaker and word, and by-speaker random slopes for voicing.
An interaction between voicing and vowel quality was also included in the final model, since it significantly improved the model.
P-values were obtained with likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model with a nested model without the tested predictor, and with `lmerTest` [@kuznetsova2016], which employs the Satterthwaite approximation to degrees of freedom.
According to the full model as specified above, Italian vowels are 22 milliseconds (SE = 6) longer if followed by a voiced stop ($\chi\^2$(3) = 16.61; p < 0.001).
The following terms and interactions were also significant: place of articulation C2, vowel identity, sentence duration, and the interaction between C2 voicing and vowel identity.

For Polish, the same model structure was used, excluding the voicing-vowel interaction (which was not significant).
Contrary to previous findings, the model reveals a significant 8 milliseconds effect (SE = 3) of consonantal voicing on the preceding vowel ($\chi\^2$(1) = 5.4, p < 0.05).
Vowel identity and sentence duration were also significant.
The place of C2 significantly improved the model ($\chi\^2$(1) = 6.1, p < 0.05), so it was included in the full model even though p > 0.05 according to the single predictor p-value.
The inspection of the model residuals confirmed the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.
The exploration of the random slopes for each speaker indicated that PL05 showed a particularly higher slope for voicing, meaning that the effect of voicing was stronger in his data, but removing this speaker from the model doesn't remove the effect.
The estimated effect of voicing on vowel duration for PL05 was 14 milliseconds.
These observations will become relevant when discussing about the results of the tongue contour data.

## Tongue contours
\label{s:splines}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=.9\textheight]{fig/tra.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison of tongue contours at the time of maximum tongue displacement (within C2 closure) in Italian (top half) and Polish (bottom half). The plotted contours are the estimated curves in the context of the vowel /a/ followed by coronal consonants. See \Cref{s:splines} for more details.}
    \label{f:tra}
\end{figure*}

The tongue contour data were analysed with GAMMs [@wood2006].
Individual GAMMs were fitted for each speaker: the \textsc{y-coordinates} of the contours were included in the model as the outcome variable; the \textsc{x-coordinates} as the only parametric term.
The following smooths were specified: a reference smooth term for the x-coordinates, three difference smooths for the x-coordinates by \textsc{voicing}, \textsc{vowel quality}, and \textsc{place} of articulation of the following consonant respectively, and \textsc{by-word} random smooths.
A first-order autoregressive model was included to correct for the high autocorrelation residuals.
Significance testing in GAMMs was achieved through model comparison and visual inspection of the difference smooth, as suggested in \citep{soskuthy2017}.
Given the poor quality of the ultrasonic data for /u/, this vowel was not included in the statistical analysis of tongue contours, hence the results reported in this section only refer to /a/ and /o/.

The analysis of the Italian ultrasonic data shows that voiced stops are produced with advancement of the root of the tongue, as expected based on previous research on English.
\Cref{f:tra} (top half) shows the predicted tongue contours in voiceless (dashed line) and voiced stops (thick line) at maximum tongue displacement for each Italian speaker.
Below each tongue contour panel, the difference smooth for voicing is also shown (black line, confidence interval in grey).
Tongue contours are significantly different in those point in which the confidence interval of the difference smooth does not include 0 on the ordinate axis.
The significantly different portions of the contours are also indicated in the figures by a shaded grey area.

In two participants out of four (IT01, IT02), the root was significantly more front in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts (/a, o/).
On the other hand, one participant (IT03) had significant tongue root advancement only following /a/, while the fourth participant (IT04) didn't show advancement at all.
For Polish (bottom half of \Cref{f:tra}), three out of four speakers (PL02, PL03, PL04) did not have tongue root advancement, while the fourth speaker (PL05) had significant advancement in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts.

Further contour analysis was carried out at C2 closure onset for the Italian and Polish speakers showing advancement.
The tongue root at closure onset was found to be in advanced in voiced consonants ().
<!-- would be interesting to compare closure and maximum with voiceless stops as well, and track displacement through time within vowel -->
<!-- Both the Italian (4 speakers) and the Polish data (1 speaker) show that the root of the tongue at the time of consonantal closure is advanced in both languages. -->
Comparisons of tongue contours at C2 onset and at the time of maximum tongue displacement in voiced consonants further indicated that the degree of root advancement was larger at maximum displacement for the Italian speakers (IT01, IT02, IT03), but not for the Polish speaker (PL05).
\Cref{f:voiced} shows the results from IT01 as a representative example for Italian and from PL05.

    \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{fig/voiced.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison of tongue contours of voiced consonants at C2 closure onset and maximum tongue displacement (within C2 closure) in IT01 (Italian) and PL05 (Polish). See \Cref{s:splines} for more details.}
    \label{f:voiced}
\end{figure*}

The ultrasonic data showed that the tongue body was raised in speakers with tongue root advancement.
The presence of this gesture in addition to root advancement makes sense from an anatomical point of view.
Raising of the tongue body could be implemented as a way to counterbalance the compression of the tongue mass caused by the advancement of the root [@perkell1969;@jackson1988;@kingston1997;@fulop1998].
It is not thus surprising to observe a raised tongue body in voiced stops accompanying root advancement.
<!--
A possible alternative account ascribes tongue body raising to aerodynamic properties of voiced stops.
Since the intra-oral pressure is higher in voiced stops due to the amount of air needed to maintain voicing, a firmer seal at the point of oral constriction could be used to compensate for the increased pressure.
Expanding the area of contact by raising the tongue body would provide for such a firmer constriction.
Could also be a matter of velocity -->

# Discussion
\label{s:discussion}

Based on the previously established link between tongue root advancement and voicing, it was proposed at the beginning of this paper that the presence of the voicing effect in a language should be correlated with the presence of tongue root advancement in voiced stops.
To test the correlation between tongue root advancement and vowel durations, ultrasonic data were collected from two languages that differ in the presence/absence of the voicing effect, Italian and Polish respectively.
It was predicted that voiced consonants should be produced with an advanced tongue root in Italian, but not in Polish.
However, the results of this study point to a more fine-grained interpretation of the proposed link between tongue root and vowel duration.
<!-- The data from most speakers pattern according to the hypothesis that a link subsists between longer vowels following voiced stops and tongue root advancement in that type of consonants. -->

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=.35\textwidth]{fig/polish-re.pdf}
    \caption{By-speaker random intercepts (left) and slopes (right) for the effect of C2 voicing on vowel duration in the Polish. The higher slope estimate (+6.3 ms) for PL05 indicates a relatively stronger effect of voicing on vowel duration for this participant.}
    \label{f:polish-re}
\end{figure}

The durational data of Polish indicate a small effect of voicing in this language, such that vowels followed by voiced stops are on average 8 milliseconds longer, contrary to previous findings in @keating1984.
The hypothesis that voiced consonants should not have tongue root advancement in Polish rests on the assumption that Polish is a non-voicing-effect language, which does not hold for the data of this study.
The voicing effect was found to be stronger in one of the Polish speakers, PL05, who has a higher random slope estimate compared to the other Polish speakers (\Cref{f:polish-re}).
Note, however, that a model fitted to the Polish data with the exclusion of PL05 still indicates a difference of 6 milliseconds in vowel duration ($\chi\^2$(1) = 8.28; p < 0.01).
Incidentally, though, PL05 is also the only Polish speaker who produced voiced consonants with an advanced tongue root, both at C2 closure onset and at the time of maximum tongue displacement.

This pattern is similar to that of the Italian speakers, who have both a relatively strong voicing effect and tongue root advancement.
This is true for all the Italian speakers in this sample, except one (IT04), who had a 22 milliseconds difference in vowel duration but whose tongue root did not differ in voiced and voiceless stops.
A possible interpretation of the different behaviour of IT04 as an age effect derives from the older age of this speaker (54 years old, vs an average of 26 for the other speakers), although a more balanced sample is needed for confirmation.

Overall, the speakers who didn't produce voiced consonants with an advanced tongue root had a relatively weaker voicing effect.
On the other hand, speakers with tongue root advancement showed a relatively strong effect, with estimates of the durational differences ranging between 15 and 30 milliseconds.
This generalisation holds independently of the speaker's language.
The fact that the degree of tongue advancement at C2 closure onset and at maximum displacement does not differ in PL05's voiced consonants could be linked to the relative weaker effect of voicing in this speaker.
All things considered, it can be inferred that, other things being equal, if a speaker realises voiced consonants with concomitant advancement of the tongue root, then that same same speaker will also show a considerable durational difference in vowels, with longer vowels preceding voiced consonants.

The smaller effect of voicing in PL05 compared to the effect in Italian (14 vs 22 milliseconds) suggests that the relationship between tongue root advancement and vowel duration might be gradual rather then categorical (presence vs. absence).
If this is the case, the magnitude of the voicing effect should correlate with the degree of tongue root advancement.
More specifically, vowel duration is predicted to be directly correlated with the degree of advancement.
Future work will set out to investigate the hypothetically gradient effect of tongue root advancement on vowel duration.

Since the intra-oral pressure is higher in voiced stops due to the amount of air needed to maintain voicing, a firmer seal at the point of oral constriction could be used to compensate for the increased pressure.
Expanding the area of contact by raising the tongue body would provide for such a firmer constriction.
Could also be a matter of velocity -->

Following the reasoning of the proposal by @halle1967, a plausible cause for the longer duration of vowels before voiced consonants with tongue root advancement (as in Italian) could therefore be the additional time required to achieve a more complex consonantal gesture---a gesture that requires adjustments of both the tongue root and the tongue dorsum/tip.
The reported absence of the voicing effect in Polish could then be ascribed to the absence of tongue root advancement in the production of voiced consonants in this language.

Complications arise from the fact that we do find a small but significant vowel duration difference in Polish, and therefore cannot claim that the voicing effect is entirely absent from Polish, in contrast to previous findings by @keating1984.
Moreover, tongue root advancement was found in one of the Polish speakers on one hand (PL05), and it was absent from one of the Italian speakers on the other (IT04).

Given the small magnitude of the effect, however, it is likely that such effect is an artefact of the difficulty of segmenting vowel to consonant transitions when the consonant is voiced [@allen1978]. Moreover, such downside would not apply to the data in PL05 given the larger estimates for the effect of voicing and the random slope, as discussed above.

A possible critique to the account proposed here is that, if an active gesture for maintaining voicing is required during the closure of voiced stops, then it is not clear how the Polish speakers can maintain voicing without tongue root advancement.
However, root advancement is not the only solution: manipulations of the larynx or of the velopharyngeal port, rather than the tongue, can also counterbalance the increased intra-oral pressure [].
The gestural timing of the larynx and the velopharyngeal port are (at least partially) anatomically independent from the timing of tongue gestures [], and would ideally not require a more complex planning as with an articulatory implementation of multiple tongue gestures. -->
