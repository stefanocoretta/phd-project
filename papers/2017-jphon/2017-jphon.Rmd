# Introduction
\label{s:intro}

This paper reports a previously undocumented link between tongue root advancement in the production of voiced stops and longer duration of the preceding vowels.
Using ultrasonic data from speakers of Italian and Polish, I demonstrate that the presence of tongue root advancement correlates with that of the so-called voicing effect, whereby vowels tend to be longer before voiced than before voiceless stops.
I further suggest that such correlation points to a new articulatory account of vowel duration as a covariate of consonantal voicing, by which tongue root advancement is proposed as a plausible diachronic precursor of the voicing effect.

An extensive number of studies show that vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents than when they are followed by voiceless obstruents [@house1953;@peterson1960;@chen1970;@klatt1973;@lisker1974;@farnetani1986;@fowler1992;@hussein1994;@esposito2002;@lampp2004;@durvasula2012].
This phenomenon, know as the voicing effect, has been reported in a variety of languages,
including (but not limited to) English, German, Hindi, Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Korean (see \citealt{maddieson1976} for a more comprehensive list).
A common stance in the literature is that the magnitude of the voicing effect differs depending on the language (although see \citealt{laeufer1992}), and that this phenomenon is not a universal tendency, since the duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following obstruents in some languages, like Polish and Czech \citep{keating1984}.
Although several attempts have been made to explain the voicing effect, an account that survives all empirical data is still lacking \citep{durvasula2012}.

To provide a rationale for the language-specificity of the voicing effect, \citet{kluender1988} propose that the source of the effect is to be found in the perceptual system.
They argue that speakers actively manipulate vowel durations to enhance the closure-duration difference which can cue the voicing distinction in obstruents.
<!-- According to another perceptually inclined account, speakers misperceive the voiced portion of the consonant closure of a voiced stop as part of the preceding vowel, which subsequently leads to the production of longer vowel durations before voiced stops \citep{javkin1976}. -->
However, \citet{fowler1992} shows by means of perceptual experiments that speakers judge vowels to be longer if the consonant closure duration is increased, and that, conversely, consonant closure is perceived to be longer when vowel duration is increased.
Fowler's experimental results thus challenge the premise that speakers exploit durational contrasts to enhance voicing distinctions.
<!-- Crucially, \citet{davis1989} demonstrate that closure duration is not employed as a cue to voicing, fact that further confutes accounts based on closure-duration enhancement. -->

In the light of the difficulties incurred by perceptual explanations, we have reason to seek an alternative account of the voicing effect with the following attributes: (1) it allows for a language-specific implementation of the voicing effect, and (2) it places the source of the effect in articulatory properties of voiced or voiceless obstruents that could favour longer or shorter vowel durations.
One of the first articulatory accounts to be proposed points to differences in the adjustment of the glottis before voiced and voiceless stops (\citealt{halle1967}, reiterated in \citealt{chomsky1968}).
\citet{halle1967} state that the glottal configuration during voicing in vowels is different from that of the closure of voiced consonants.
Their argument is that vowels are longer before voiced consonants so that more time is available to the glottis to achieve a position suitable for maintaining within-closure voicing.
This guarantees that such configuration is secured before the onset of the consonant closure.
Later studies, however, established that the glottal configuration of voicing in obstruents does not differ from the one in vowels \citep{lisker1974,kagaya1975}.
As a consequence of this observation, it is reasonable to look for the articulatory source of the voicing effect not in properties of vocal folds activity during obstruent voicing, but rather in the supra-glottal adjustments that accompany it.
<!-- This suggests that the articulatory source of the voicing effect should be sought not in the action of the glottis during obstruent voicing, but rather in the supra-glottal adjustments that accompany it. -->
<!-- Hence, the claim that vowels are longer to allow glottal adjustments cannot be supported empirically. -->

One of the known differences in supra-glottal articulation between voiced and voiceless consonants concerns the position of the tongue root along the front-back plane of the oral tract.
It has been observed that the tongue root is in a more advanced position in voiced than in voiceless stops \citep{kent1969,perkell1969,westbury1983}.
This gesture has been interpreted as a mechanism to ensure voicing during closure.
The realisation of vocal fold vibration (i.e. voicing) requires the air pressure in the supra-glottal cavity to be lower than the air pressure below the glottis.
During the production of voiced obstruents, the supra-glottal pressure quickly increases.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to maintain voicing during closure, to the point that voicing can cease if the supra-glottal pressure is higher than the sub-glottal pressure [@ohala2011].
An articulatory solution to counterbalance the increase in pressure is to expand the supra-glottal cavity by advancing the root of the tongue.
The ability to lower the supra-glottal air pressure by advancing the tongue root is put to a different use in Korean, where it facilitates the maintenance of short lag VOT in tense stops [@ahn2016].

<!-- need to mention speaker control of TRA -->

<!-- Drawing on ultrasound tongue imaging data, @ahn2016 show that tongue root advancement not only favours voicing in English voiced stops, but it also facilitates a short lag VOT in the tense stops of Korean. -->
<!-- demonstrate that the root of the tongue is advanced during the articulation of voiced consonants in American English, even when voicing is not implemented during the closure in underlyingly voiced stops. -->
The link between tongue root advancement and properties of phonation like voicing and VOT duration on one hand, and between voicing and duration of vowels on the other, raises the question of whether a direct correlation exists between tongue root advancement and vowel duration.
If tongue root advancement plays a role in determining the presence or development of the voicing effect, then it is expected that voiced consonants should be articulated with tongue root advancement in voicing-effect languages, but not in languages without the voicing effect.

For this study ultrasonic tongue data were recorded from speakers of Italian and Polish, two languages that have been reported to have and lack the voicing effect respectively.
In an investigation of the general properties of segmental durations of Italian, @farnetani1986 show that the first vowel in /lada/ is on average 35 milliseconds longer than the vowel in /lata/ ($\bar{x}$ = 223 ms, sd = 18 in /lata/; $\bar{x}$ = 258 ms, sd = 13 in /lada/, \citealt[26]{farnetani1986}).
@esposito2002 extends Farnetani's research to all the vowels and stops of Italian and confirms that vowels are longer when followed by a voiced stop, with an estimated mean duration similar to that reported in @farnetani1986.
<!-- Add two papers that will come through document supply -->
As for Polish, although a difference of 2 milliseconds in vowel duration can be observed (167.5 ms in /rata/, 169.5 ms in /rada/), such difference has been deemed as non-significant according to statistical testing [@keating1984].
Vowels in Polish are thus not affected by the voicing of the following consonant.

Based on the hypothesis that tongue root advancement correlates with the voicing effect (and hence with vowel duration), the expectations with regard to Italian and Polish are the following: (1) since vowels are longer before voiced stops in Italian, voiced stops in this language should be articulated with tongue root advancement, and (2) given that vowels before voiceless and voiced stops in Polish are about the same duration, the position of the tongue root in voiced stops should not differ from that of voiceless stops.

<!--
It is known that the root of the tongue can play a role in maintaining voicing during the closure of voiced stop consonants \citep{halle1967,kent1969,perkell1969,westbury1983}.
The production of vocal fold vibration requires a pressure differential between the sub-glottal and the supra-glottal cavities (with lower pressure in the supra-glottal cavity).
During the production of voiced obstruents, the pressure in the supra-glottal cavity quickly increases, due to the additional air injected from the lungs in the supra-glottal cavity, which is completely sealed in stops.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to maintain voicing during closure, at the point that voicing can stop if the lowest threshold of pressure differential is reached and surpassed.

@westbury1983 argues that one way to counterbalance the pressure increase in the supra-glottal cavity is to enlarge the cavity through the advancement of the tongue root.
Drawing from ultrasound tongue imaging, @ahn2016 demonstrate that the root of the tongue is advanced during the articulation of voiced consonants in American English.
They also showed that tongue root advancement is present even when vocal fold vibration is not implemented during closure in underlyingly voiced stops.
An interesting question arising from the connection between voicing and tongue root is weather the advancement of the root is correlated with other phonetic characteristics, like the duration of vowels preceding stops.
Such hypothesis will be expanded on in this section, after a brief overview of work on the effect of consonant voicing on vowel duration.

An extensive pool of studies shows that vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents and shorter when followed by voiceless obstruents (\citealt{house1953,chen1970,klatt1973,lisker1973}, just to mention a few).
Most of the literature on this phenomenon, known as the 'voicing effect,' suggests that different languages show different magnitudes of such durational differential, and that in some other languages the duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following obstruent.\footnote{For a different opinion on the first matter, see \citet{laeufer1992}.}
Although several attempts have been put forward to explain the effect of voicing on vowel durations, no consensus has been reached to date.
Nonetheless, a recurrent theme focusses on the differences that characterise the gestural implementation of voiced and voiceless stops.\footnote{However, see \citet{javkin1976} and \citet{kluender1988} for two perceptually inclined proposals.}

One of the earliest articulatory accounts of the voicing effect attributed the difference in vowel duration to the divergent configuration of the vocal folds between voicing in sonorants and in obstruents [@halle1967; reiterated in @chomsky1968].
According to @halle1967, voicing in obstruents is produced with a state of the glottis that is different from the configuration necessary to produce vocal fold vibration in sonorants like vowels.
On the contrary, they claim that voiceless stops do not require any specific glottal configuration and thus the voicing of the preceding vowel can just naturally cease at closure (or a few milliseconds after it).
@halle1967 thus hypothesise that, to allow the glottal state to change from the sonorant voicing of the preceding vowel to obstruent voicing, the vowel is lengthened so that enough time is available for such adjustments to happen.

Although such account seemed promising at the time it was proposed, later studies failed to demonstrate that obstruent voicing is any different from sonorant voicing [].
Given the established connection between voicing and tongue root advancement, the hypothesis follows that tongue root advancement could also be linked to vowel duration.
If this were the case, a language in which vowels have different durations depending on the voicing of the following consonant should also show tongue root advancement in voiced stops, while tongue root advancement should not be employed in those languages in which vowel durations are not affected by voicing.
Building on the hypothesis in @halle1967, I put forward an account in which a relatively more complex tongue gesture in voiced consonants requires a longer time to be achieved (\Cref{s:discussion}).

In this paper, I focus on two languages, Italian and Polish, that have been reported to show and lack the voicing effect respectively.
In a study assessing general properties on segmental durations of spoken Italian, @farnetani1986 shows that the first vowel in /lada/ is on average 35 milliseconds longer than the vowel in /lata/ (/lata/ 223 msec, sd = 18; /lada/ 258 msec, sd = 13, p. 26).
@esposito2002 extends Farnetanis's research to all vowels and stops and demonstrates that vowels are longer when followed by a voiced stop, with an estimate similar to what reported in @farnetani1986.
<!-- Add two papers that will come through document supply -->
<!-- On the other hand, @keating1984 reports that vowels in Polish are not affected by the voicing of the following consonant.
The average duration of the first vowel in /rata/ is 167.5 milliseconds, while the pre-consonantal vowel in /rada/ is just two milliseconds longer.
Based on the hypothesis put forward that there is a link between tongue root advancement and the voicing effect, it is expected that Italian will show tongue root advancement, while Polish will lack such articulatory gesture in the implementation of voiced stops. -->

<!-- actually it's Keating 1979 PhD dissertation -->
<!-- The duration of vowels n in the word pair /rata/ ~ /rada/ and found that there was a durational difference of 2 milliseconds.
As for the some of the Italian studies, statistical analysis was not performed, although judging by the size of the difference, it can be assumed that it is not significant. -->

Eight native speakers of Italian (2 females, 2 males) and Polish (2 females, 2 males) were recorded in Manchester and in Italy (see \Cref{t:participants}).
The Italian speakers were from Northern Italy (three from the north-west and one from north-east).
The Polish group was more heterogeneous, with two speakers from the West (Poznań), and two from the East (Warsaw and Przasnysz).
Ethical clearance was obtained for this study from the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76).
The participants received a small monetary compensation.

## Equipment set-up
\label{s:equipment}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{../../graphics/uti-setup.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic representation of the equipment setup (\citealt{articulate2011}). The system is described in details in \Cref{s:equipment}.}
    \label{f:uti-setup}
\end{figure*}

An Articulate Instruments Ltd™ set-up was used for this study (\Cref{f:uti-setup}).
The ultrasonic data was collected through a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit with a TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer (20mm radius, 2-4 MHz).
A synchronisation unit (P-Stretch) was plugged into the Echo Blaster unit and used for automatic audio/ultrasound synchronisation.
A FocusRight Scarlett Solo pre-amplifier and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used for audio recording.
The acquisition of the ultrasonic and audio signals was achieved with the software Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA, v2.17.2) running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows 7.
Stabilisation of the ultrasonic transducer was ensured by using a headset produced by Articulate Instruments Ltd™ (\citeyear{articulate2008}).

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} = V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/, etc.), giving a total of 12 target words.
A labial stop was chosen as the first consonant to reduce possible coarticulation with the following vowel (although see \citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007}).
Only coronal and velar stops were used as target consonants since labial consonants cannot be imaged with ultrasonography.
The target words were embedded in a frame sentence.
Prosodically similar sentences were used to ensure comparability between languages.
The frame sentence was *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' for Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish.

## Procedure

The sentences with the target words were randomised for each participant, although the order was kept the same between repetitions within participant due to software constraints.
Each participant repeated the list of randomised stimuli six times.
A grand total of 576 tokens (288 per language) was recorded.
The participant's occlusal plane was obtained using a bite plate [@scobbie2011], and the hard palate was imaged by asking the participant to swallow water [@epstein2005].
The frame rate of the acquisition of the ultrasonic data ranged between 43 and 68 frames per second.
Other settings values varied depending on the frame rate.
The ranges of these settings in this study were: scanlines = 88–114, pixel per scanline = 980–988, field of view = 71–93, pixel offset = 109–263, depth (mm) = 75–180.
The audio signal was recorded at 22050 MHz (16-bit).

## Data processing and analysis

Synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signal was achieved in post-processing, using a built-in procedure of AAA.
The audio data were subject to force alignment using the SPeech Phonetisation Alignment and Syllabification software (SPPAS) [@bigi2015].
The outcome of the automatic annotation was manually corrected after the force alignment, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.
The onset of the target consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected automatically in Praat [@boersma2016] by means of the algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.
The durations of the following intervals were extracted from the annotated acoustic landmarks using an automated procedure in Praat: vowel duration (V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant duration (V1 offset to V2 onset), and closure duration (V1 offset to C2 burst).

<!--
The outcome of the automatic annotation was then manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.: the target vowel onset (V1 onset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of appearance of higher formants in the spectrogram following the burst of /p/ (C1); the target vowel offset (V1 offset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of disappearance of the higher formants in the spectrogram; this point also coincides with the consonant onset (C2 onset) and the closure onset (C2 closure onset); consonant offset (C2 offset) was marked by visual inspection at the time of formants onsets of the following vowel.
The onset of the consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected automatically employing a Praat implementation of the algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.

Spline curves were automatically fitted to the visible contours using the AAA batch tracking function.
Manual correction was applied in those cases that showed clear tracking errors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement within consonant closure was then calculated in AAA following the method in @strycharczuk2015.
A fan-like frame consisting of 42 equidistant radial lines was used as the coordinate system.
The origin of the 42 fan-lines coincides with the centre of the ultrasonic probe, such that each fan-line is parallel to the direction of the ultrasonic signal.
Tongue displacement was thus calculated as the displacement of the fitted splines along the fan-line vectors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement was the time of greater displacement along the vector that showed the greatest standard deviation.
The vector search area was restricted to the portion of the splines corresponding to the tongue tip for coronal consonants, and to the portion corresponding to the tongue dorsum for velar consonants.
<!-- The displacement was calculated based on the movement of the splines along one of the 42 fan lines.
Fan line selection in this study was achieved by finding the fan line within the relevant area of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for velar consonants) with the highest standard deviation of displacement.
-->

The cartesian coordinates of the tongue contours were exported from two time points: the onset of C2 closure, and the time of maximum tongue displacement (which is always within C2 closure).
The contours were normalised within speaker by applying offsetting and rotation relative to the participant’s occlusal plane [@scobbie2011].
<!-- on the inspection of the standard deviation of the splines in the relevant area of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for velar consonants).
The fan line that showed the highest standard deviation within the relevant area was used for calculating displacement.
Tongue displacement velocity and tangential velocity were then derived.
The time of maximum displacement was finally obtained from tangential velocity [@strycharczuk2015]. -->
The durational data were analysed with linear mixed effects models using `lme4` in R [@r-core-team2017; @bates2015].
*P*-values were obtained with likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model with a nested model without the relevant predictor.
<!-- P-values were obtained with likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model with a nested model without the tested predictor, and with `lmerTest` [@kuznetsova2016], which employs the Satterthwaite approximation to degrees of freedom. -->
Generalised additive mixed models [GAMMs, @wood2006;@zuur2012] were used for the statistical analysis of tongue contour data.
Significance testing in GAMMs was achieved through model comparison with `itsadug` [@van-rij2017] and visual inspection of the difference smooth, as suggested in \citet{soskuthy2017}.
A first-order autoregressive model was used to correct for the high autocorrelation of the residuals in GAMMs.

# Results

The following sections report the results of the durational data (\Cref{s:vow-duration}), and of the ultrasonic data (\Cref{s:splines}) separately.
Given the poor quality of the ultrasonic data for /u/, this vowel was not included in the statistical analysis of tongue contours, but the durational data of /u/ were kept in the linear regression models.
The results in \Cref{s:splines} thus refer only to /a/ and /o/.

## Vowel duration and voicing
\label{s:vow-duration}

A linear mixed effects regression model was fitted to the Italian vowel duration data with \textsc{vowel duration} (in milliseconds) as the outcome variable; \textsc{vowel identity} (/a, o, u/), \textsc{voicing} (voiceless vs. voiced) and \textsc{place of articulation} (coronal vs. velar) of the following consonant, \textsc{sentence duration} (in seconds) as fixed effects; \textsc{by-speaker} and \textsc{by-word} random \textsc{intercepts}, and \textsc{by-speaker} random \textsc{coefficients} for voicing.
An interaction between voicing and vowel quality was also included, since it significantly improved the model.
According to the full model as specified above, Italian vowels are 22 milliseconds longer (se = 6) if followed by a voiced stop ($\chi$\textsuperscript{2} = 16.61; p < 0.001; df = 3; see \Cref{t:lmer-italian} for a summary of the fixed effects).
<!-- The following terms and interactions were also significant: place of articulation C2, vowel identity, sentence duration, and the interaction between C2 voicing and vowel identity. -->

For Polish, the same model structure was used, to the exclusion of the voicing/vowel-identity interaction (which did not improve the model).
Contrary to previous findings, the model reveals an 8 millisecond effect (se = 3) of consonantal voicing on the preceding vowel ($\chi$\textsuperscript{2} = 5.4; p < 0.05; df = 1; see \Cref{t:lmer-polish} for a summary of the fixed effects).
Vowel identity, C2 place of articulation, and sentence duration also had an effect on vowel duration.
<!-- The place of C2 significantly improved the model ($\chi\^2$ = 6.1; p < 0.05; df = 1), so it was included even though it is deemed as non significant according to the single predictor p-value (*t* = -2.3; ns; df = 7). -->
The inspection of the model residuals confirmed the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.

    \label{f:polish-re}
\end{figure}

The exploration of the random coefficients for each speaker indicated that PL05 has a particularly higher coefficient for voicing, meaning that the effect of voicing is stronger in his data (\Cref{f:polish-re}).
Note that the exclusion of this speaker from the model doesn't remove the effect ($\beta$ = 6 ms; se = 2; $\chi\^2$ = 8.28; p < 0.01; df = 1).
The estimated effect of voicing on vowel duration for PL05 was about 14 milliseconds (vowels followed by voiced stops are on average 14 ms longer in PL05).
These observations will become relevant in the next section, in which the results of the tongue contour data will be discussed.

## Tongue contours
\label{s:splines}

    \caption{Comparison of tongue contours at the time of maximum tongue displacement (within C2 closure) in Italian (top half) and Polish (bottom half). The plotted contours are the estimated curves in the context of the vowel /a/ followed by coronal consonants. By-voicing difference smooths are shown below the estimated curves. See \Cref{s:splines} for more details.}
    \label{f:tra}
\end{figure*}

GAMMs were fitted to the data of each speaker individually: the \textsc{y-coordinates} of the contours were included in the model as the outcome variable; the \textsc{x-coordinates} as the only parametric term.
The following smooths were specified: a \textsc{reference smooth} term for the \textsc{x-coordinates}, three \textsc{difference smooths} for the x-coordinates by \textsc{voicing}, \textsc{vowel identity}, and \textsc{place} of articulation of the following consonant respectively, and \textsc{by-word random smooths}.

The analysis of the Italian ultrasonic data shows that voiced stops are produced with advancement of the tongue root.
\Cref{f:tra} (top half) shows for each Italian speaker the estimated tongue contours in voiceless (dashed green lines) and voiced stops (continuous blue lines) at the time of maximum tongue displacement.
Below each tongue contour panel, the by-voicing difference smooth is also shown (confidence interval in grey).
Tongue contours are significantly different in those points in which the confidence interval of the difference smooth does not include 0 on the ordinate axis (also indicated by a shaded red background).

In two participants out of four (IT01, IT02), the root was significantly more front in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts (/a, o/).
On the other hand, one participant (IT03) had tongue root advancement only in the context of the vowel /a/, while the fourth participant (IT04) didn't show advancement at all.
For Polish (bottom half of \Cref{f:tra}), three out of four speakers (PL02, PL03, PL04) did not have tongue root advancement, while the fourth speaker (PL05) had significant advancement in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts.

An additional contour analysis was carried out at C2 closure onset for the Italian and Polish speakers showing advancement.
The tongue root at closure onset was found to be advanced in the voiced consonants of all these speakers.
<!-- would be interesting to compare closure and maximum with voiceless stops as well, and track displacement through time within vowel -->
<!-- Both the Italian (4 speakers) and the Polish data (1 speaker) show that the root of the tongue at the time of consonantal closure is advanced in both languages. -->
Comparisons of tongue contours at C2 onset and at the time of maximum tongue displacement in voiced consonants further indicated that the degree of root advancement was larger at maximum displacement for the Italian speakers (IT01, IT02, IT03), but not for the Polish speaker (PL05).
\Cref{f:voiced} exemplifies the results with the model results from IT01 and PL05.

\end{figure*}

The ultrasonic data also showed that the tongue body was raised in speakers with tongue root advancement.
The presence of this additional gesture makes sense from an anatomical point of view.
Raising the tongue body is a way to counterbalance the compression of the tongue mass caused by the advancement of the root [@perkell1969;@jackson1988;@sproat1993;@kingston1997;@fulop1998].
It is thus not surprising to observe a raised tongue body in voiced stops accompanying root advancement.
<!--
A possible alternative account ascribes tongue body raising to aerodynamic properties of voiced stops.
Since the intra-oral pressure is higher in voiced stops due to the amount of air needed to maintain voicing, a firmer seal at the point of oral constriction could be used to compensate for the increased pressure.
Expanding the area of contact by raising the tongue body would provide for such a firmer constriction.
Could also be a matter of velocity -->

# Discussion
\label{s:discussion}

Based on the previously established link between tongue root advancement and voicing, it was proposed at the beginning of this paper that the presence of the voicing effect in a language could be correlated with the presence of tongue root advancement in the voiced stops of that language.
To test the correlation between tongue root advancement and vowel durations, ultrasonic data were collected from speakers of two languages that differ in the presence/absence of the voicing effect, Italian and Polish respectively.
It was predicted that voiced consonants should be produced with an advanced tongue root in Italian, but not in Polish.
The results of this study do not bear out this simple scenario, however, suggesting instead that the voicing effect is related to tongue root advancement in voiced stops in a complex way.
<!-- This was not born out by the data presented here.
The results of this study rather indicate that tongue root advancement in voiced stops correlates with the voicing effect in a more complex way than initially thought. -->
<!-- This section will discuss ... and the implications of the findings reported in this paper with regard to the source of the voicing effect. -->
<!-- However, the results of this study point to a more fine-grained interpretation of the proposed link between tongue root and vowel duration. -->
<!-- The data from most speakers pattern according to the hypothesis that a link subsists between longer vowels following voiced stops and tongue root advancement in that type of consonants. -->

@keating1984 investigated the effect of consonant voicing on the duration of preceding vowels in Polish and reported that vowels followed by voiceless and voiced stops do not differ in duration.
Nevertheless, the analysis of the durational data discussed above indicates that an effect of voicing exists in the Polish speakers of this study, such that vowels followed by voiced stops are on average 8 milliseconds longer.
The hypothesis that voiced consonants should not have tongue root advancement in Polish rested on previous reports that Polish is a non-voicing-effect language.
The data from this study indicate instead the presence of a voicing effect.
Crucially, the Polish speaker with the strongest effect of voicing (PL05, cf. \Cref{s:vow-duration}) is also the only Polish speaker who produced voiced consonants with an advanced tongue root, both at C2 closure onset and at the time of maximum tongue displacement.

This pattern is similar to that of the Italian speakers, who have both a relatively strong voicing effect and tongue root advancement.
This is true for all the speakers of Italian in this sample, except IT04.
The vowels in this speaker are 22 milliseconds longer when followed by voiced stops, but her tongue root position does not differ in voiced and voiceless stops (see below for a tentative explanation).
<!-- The interpretation of IT04's different behaviour as an age effect suggests itself given the older age of this speaker (54 year old vs. the average age of the other Italian speaker, which was 26). -->

Overall, the speakers who produced voiced consonants with an advanced tongue root had a relatively strong voicing effect, with estimates of the durational differences ranging between 15 and 30 milliseconds.
Bear in mind that the inverse is not true: IT04 had a strong voicing effect, without accompanying tongue root advancement.
Nonetheless, the generalisation that tongue root advancement is correlated with a relatively strong voicing effect holds independently of the speaker's language: speakers of both Italian and Polish pattern according to this principle.
All things considered, the following implication can be inferred: if a speaker realises voiced consonants with concomitant advancement of the tongue root, other things being equal, then that same speaker will also show a considerable durational difference in vowels, with longer vowels preceding voiced consonants.

The fact that the degree of tongue advancement at C2 closure onset and at maximum displacement does not differ in PL05's voiced consonants could be linked to the relative weaker effect of voicing in this speaker compared to the Italian speakers (14 vs 22 milliseconds).
The weaker voicing effect in PL05 suggests that the relationship between tongue root advancement and vowel duration might be gradient rather then categorical (presence vs. absence).
If this is the case, the magnitude of the voicing effect should correlate with the degree of tongue root advancement.
More specifically, vowel duration is predicted to be directly correlated with the degree of advancement.
Future work will set out to investigate the putative gradient effect of tongue root advancement on vowel duration.

<!-- ## An articulatory precursor of the voicing effect -->
<!-- \label{s:source} -->

The association between a relatively strong voicing effect and tongue root advancement in voiced stops constitutes the premise for the discussion of tongue root advancement as the precursor of the voicing effect.
As pointed out in \Cref{s:intro}, the source of the voicing effect should be found among the supra-glottal articulatory properties of stops.
Such putative source should also be subject to language- and/or speaker-specific behaviour.
As evinced from the data presented here, tongue root advancement satisfies both of these requirements.

Tongue root advancement as an oral gesture does not need discussion, since it involves a lingual articulation.
As for the second requisite, the results of this study show that speakers can adopt tongue root advancement or not, but, if they do, they do so in such a way that the root in voiced stops is already advanced at the onset of the consonant closure.
The most straightforward interpretation is that the advancement of the root is initiated before the consonant closure is achieved.
This implies that the advancement gesture is implemented even during the articulation of the vowel.
Adapting the reasoning of the proposal by Halle and Stevens (1967, see \Cref{s:intro}), a possible source of the longer duration of vowels before voiced consonants could therefore be the additional time required to achieve tongue root advancement in the context of voiced stops.

Such gestural account is intended as a diachronic source of the voicing effect, rather than as a mechanic condition according to which the voicing effect should be observed synchronically.
This is in compliance with the fact that one speaker of Italian did not produce voiced consonants with tongue root advancement, while still having a relatively strong voicing effect.
A speculative explanation is that, once a strong voicing effect is stabilised in a language (or a variety of a language), speakers of that language will learn the effect while being able to adopt different strategies to cope with the decreasing trans-glottal pressure drop.

To conclude, the gestural-timing account proposed here places greater emphasis on the size of the effect of voicing on vowel duration.
If present, tongue root advancement is expected to co-occur with a relatively stronger voicing effect.
As we saw earlier, the presence of tongue root advancement in the Polish speaker PL05 was accompanied by an 8 millisecond increase in the degree to which voicing affects vowel duration.
This aspect, coupled with the hypothesis explored above that the effect of voicing on vowel duration could be gradient, evidently illustrates the complexity of this phenomenon, which has being escaping our understanding for almost a century.

# Conclusion
\label{s:conclusion}

This paper focussed on the so called voicing effect, by which vowels tend to be longer before voiced than before voiceless stops in a variety of languages.
No consensus has been reached in the literature regarding the source of this effect.
Voicing in stops has long been known to be facilitated by pharyngeal cavity expansion, which is often implemented by means of tongue root advancement.
I therefore offered the hypothesis that tongue root advancement in voiced stops might play a role in determining the presence vs. absence of the voicing effect in a particular language.

Drawing on acoustic and ultrasonic data from Italian (a voicing-effect language) and Polish (a non-voicing-effect language), I showed that:

* Vowels followed by voiced stops are on average 22 milliseconds longer in Italian and 6 milliseconds longer in Polish.
* Voiced stops were realised with tongue root advancement in three Italian speakers and one Polish speaker.
* The durational increment in the Polish speaker with tongue root advancement is double compared to the other Polish speakers, although still smaller than that of the Italian speakers.
* Tongue root advancement was found at closure onset and within closure in voiced consonants in Italian and Polish.
* The advancement of the root increases during closure in the Italian speakers but not in the Polish speaker.

These results indicate that tongue root advancement does not determine the presence of the voicing effect or its absence, but it is rather correlated with vowel duration in a more complex way.
More specifically, the difference in vowel duration was greater in speakers who produce voiced consonants with tongue root advancement, than in speakers without tongue root advancement, independent of their language.
I thus advanced the hypothesis that the relation between the degree of tongue root advancement and the magnitude of the voicing effect is gradient rather than a matter of presence vs. absence.
Finally, it was speculated that the additional time required for the tongue root to reach an advanced position is a possible diachronic precursor of the longer duration of vowels followed by voiced stops.

<!--
Following the reasoning of the proposal by @halle1967, a plausible cause for the longer duration of vowels before voiced consonants with tongue root advancement (as in Italian) could therefore be the additional time required to achieve a more complex consonantal gesture---a gesture that requires adjustments of both the tongue root and the tongue dorsum/tip.
The reported absence of the voicing effect in Polish could then be ascribed to the absence of tongue root advancement in the production of voiced consonants in this language.

Complications arise from the fact that we do find a small but significant vowel duration difference in Polish, and therefore cannot claim that the voicing effect is entirely absent from Polish, in contrast to previous findings by @keating1984.
Moreover, tongue root advancement was found in one of the Polish speakers on one hand (PL05), and it was absent from one of the Italian speakers on the other (IT04).

Given the small magnitude of the effect, however, it is likely that such effect is an artefact of the difficulty of segmenting vowel to consonant transitions when the consonant is voiced [@allen1978]. Moreover, such downside would not apply to the data in PL05 given the larger estimates for the effect of voicing and the random slope, as discussed above.

A possible critique to the account proposed here is that, if an active gesture for maintaining voicing is required during the closure of voiced stops, then it is not clear how the Polish speakers can maintain voicing without tongue root advancement.
However, root advancement is not the only solution: manipulations of the larynx or of the velopharyngeal port, rather than the tongue, can also counterbalance the increased intra-oral pressure [].
The gestural timing of the larynx and the velopharyngeal port are (at least partially) anatomically independent from the timing of tongue gestures [], and would ideally not require a more complex planning as with an articulatory implementation of multiple tongue gestures. -->
