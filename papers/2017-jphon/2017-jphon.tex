\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

It is known that the root of the tongue can play a role in maintaining
voicing during the closure of voiced stop consonants. The production of
vocal fold vibration requires a pressure differential between the
sub-glottal and the supra-glottal cavities (with lower pressure in the
supra-glottal cavity). During the production of voiced obstruents, the
pressure in the supra-glottal cavity quickly increases, due to the
additional air injected from the lungs in the supra-glottal cavity,
which is completely sealed in stops. Such pressure increase can hinder
the ability to maintain voicing during closure, at the point that
voicing can stop if the lowest threshold of pressure differential is
reached and surpassed.

\citet{westbury1983} argued that one way to counterbalance the pressure
increase in the supra-glottal cavity is to enlarge the cavity through
expansion of the pharyngeal walls. One way to achieve this is to advance
the root of the tongue. \citet{ahn2016} have recently demonstrated,
drawing from ultrasound tongue imaging, that the root of the tongue is
advanced during the articulation of voiced consonants in American
English. They also showed that tongue root advancement is present even
when vocal fold vibration is not implemented during closure in
underlyingly voiced stops. An interesting question arising from the
connection between voicing and tongue root is weather the advancement of
the root is correlated with other phonetic characteristics, like the
duration of vowels preceding stops.

An extensive pool of studies showed that vowels tend to be longer when
followed by voiced obstruents and shorter when followed by voiceless
obstruents \citep[just to mention a
few]{house1953, chen1970, klatt1973, lisker1973}. Most of the literature
on the topic suggests that different languages show different magnitudes
of such durational differential, and that in some other languages the
duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following
obstruent.\footnote{For a different opinion on the first matter, see \citet{laeufer1992}.}
Although several attempts have been put forward to explain the effect of
voicing on vowel durations, no consensus has been reached to date.
Nonetheless, a recurrent theme focusses on the differences that
characterise the gestural implementation of voiced and voiceless
stops.\footnote{However, see \citet{javkin1976} and \citet{kluender1988} for two perceptually inclined proposals.}

One of the earliest articulatory accounts of the voicing effect
attributed the difference in vowel duration to the divergent
configuration of the vocal folds in sonorant and obstruent voicing
\citetext{\citealp{halle1967}; \citealp[reiterated in][]{chomsky1968}}.
According to \citet{halle1967}, voicing in obstruents is produced with a
state of the glottis that is different from the configuration necessary
to produce vocal fold vibration in sonorants like vowels. On the
contrary, they claim that voiceless stops do not require any specific
glottal configuration and thus the voicing perpetuated during the vowel
can just naturally ceases at closure (or a few milliseconds after it).
The authors thus hypothesise that, to allow the glottal state to change
from sonorant voicing to obstruent voicing, the vowel is lengthen so
that enough time is available for the adjustments to happen.

Although such account seemed promising at the time it was proposed,
later studies failed to demonstrate that obstruent voicing is any
different from sonorant voicing {[}{]}. Given the established connection
between voicing and tongue root advancement, the hypothesis follows that
tongue root advancement could also be linked to vowel duration. If this
were the case, a language in which vowels have different durations
depending on the voicing of the following consonant should also show
tongue root advancement in voiced stops, while tongue root advancement
should not be employed in those languages in which vowel durations are
not affected by voicing. On the same line of the hypothesis in
\citet{halle1967}, I put forward an account in which a more complex
tongue gesture in voiced consonants requires a longer time to be
achieved (\Cref{s:discussion}).

In a study assessing general properties on segmental durations of spoken
Italian, \citet{farnetani1986} found that the first vowel in /lada/ was
on average 35 msec longer than the vowel in /lata/ (/lata/ 223 msec, sd
= 18; /lada/ 258 msec, sd = 13, p.~26). \citet{esposito2002} extended
Farnetanis's research to all vowels and stops and found that vowels were
longer when followed by a voiced stop, with an estimate similar to what
reported in \citet{farnetani1986}. Vowels in Polish, on the other hand,
are not affected by the voicing of the following consonant, according to
\citet{keating1984}. For these reasons, Italian and Polish have been
chosen as the two test languages for this study.

Eight native speakers of Italian (2 females, 2 males) and Polish (2
females, 2 males) have been recorded in Manchester and in Italy
(\Cref{t:participants}). The Italian speakers were from Northern Italy
(three from the Northwest and one from Northeast). The Polish group was
more heterogeneous, with two speakers from Poznań, one from Przasnysz,
and one from Warsaw. This research has obtained ethic clearance from the
University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76). The participants received a
small monetary compensation.

\subsection{Equipment set-up}\label{equipment-set-up}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{../../graphics/uti-setup.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic representation of the equipment setup (\citealt{articulate2011}, see text for details).}
    \label{f:uti-setup}
\end{figure*}

An Articulate Instruments Inc. set-up was used for this study
(\Cref{f:uti-setup}). This was constituted by a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128
unit with a TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer (20mm radius,
2-4 MHz). A synchronisation unit (P-Stretch) was plugged into the Echo
Blaster unit and used for automatic audio/ultrasound synchronisation. A
FocusRight pre-amplifier and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used
for audio recording. The acquisition of the ultrasonic and audio signals
was achieved with the software Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA,
v2.17.2) running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with
Microsoft Windows 7. Stabilisation of the ultrasonic transducer was
ensured by using a stabilisation headset produced by Articulate
Instruments Inc. (not shown in the figure).

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}

Disyllabic words of the form
C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2}
were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1}
= /a, o, u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} =
V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/, etc.), yielding a total
of 12 target words. A labial stop was chosen as the first consonant to
reduce influence on the following vowel (although cf.
\citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007}). Only coronal and velar stops were used
as target consonants since labial consonants cannot be imaged with
ultrasonography. The target words were embedded in a frame sentence.
Prosodically similar sentences were used to ensure comparability between
languages. The frame sentence was \emph{Dico X lentamente} `I say X
slowly' for Italian, and \emph{Mówię X teraz} `I say X now' for Polish.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

The sentences with the target words were randomised for each
participant, although the order was kept the same between repetitions
within participant due to software constraints. Each participant
repeated the list of randomised stimuli six times. The participant's
occlusal plane was obtained using a bite plate, and the hard palate was
imaged by asking the participant to swallow water \citep{scobbie2011}.
The frame rate of the acquisition of the ultrasonic data varied between
55 and 65 frames per second (one frame every 15-18 milliseconds). The
audio signal was recorded at 22050 MHz (16-bit).

\subsection{Data processing}\label{data-processing}

Synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signal was achieved in
post-processing, using a built-in procedure of AAA. The data were then
subject to force alignment using the SPPAS force aligner
\citep{bigi2015}. The outcome of the automatic annotation was then
manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.
The onset of the target consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected
automatically in Praat \citep{boersma2016}, employing a implementation
of the algorithm described in \citet{ananthapadmanabha2014}. The
durations of the following intervals were then extracted from the
acoustic landmarks using an automated procedure in Praat: vowel duration
(V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant duration (V1 offset to V2 onset), and
closure duration (V1 offset to C2 burst).

Tongue contours were extracted from the ultrasonic data using AAA.
Spline curves were first fitted to the visible contours using the AAA
batch tracking function. Manual correction was applied in those cases
that showed clear tracking errors. The time of maximum tongue
displacement within consonant closure was then calculated in AAA
following the method in \citet{strycharczuk2015}. Fan line selection in
this study was achieved by finding the fan line within the relevant area
of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for
velar consonants) with the highest standard deviation of displacement.

\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}

The tongue contours coordinates were exported at two time points: (1) at
the onset of C2 closure, and (2) at maximum tongue displacement (within
C2 closure). The contours were normalised by applying offsetting and
rotation relative to the participant's occlusal plane
\citep{scobbie2011}. Generalised additive mixed effects regression
models \citep[GAMMs,][]{wood2006} were used for the statistical analysis
of tongue contour data in R \citep{r-core-team2017}. Duration
measurements were subject to linear mixed effects models using
\texttt{lme4} in R \citep{bates2015}.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Vowel duration and
voicing}\label{vowel-duration-and-voicing}

A linear mixed effects regression model was fitted on the Italian vowel
duration data with \textsc{duration} as the outcome variable;
\textsc{vowel quality} (/a, o, u/), \textsc{voicing} and
\textsc{place of articulation} of the following consonant,
\textsc{sentence duration} as fixed effects; random intercepts by
speaker and word, and by-speaker random slopes for voicing. An
interaction between voicing and vowel quality was also included in the
final model, since it significantly improved the model. P-values were
obtained through likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model
including voicing with a null model without voicing as a predictor.
According to the full model, Italian vowels are 19.5 milliseconds (±5.5
standard errors) longer if followed by a voiced stop (\(\chi^2\)(3) =
18.5, p = 0.000337).

For Polish, the same model structure was used, excluding the
voicing-vowel interaction (which was not significant). Surprisingly, the
model reported a partially significant 8 milliseconds (±3 standard
errors) effect of consonantal voicing on the preceding vowel
(\(\chi^2\)(1) = 5.4, p = 0.02). The exploration of the random slopes
for each speaker indicated that PL05 showed a particularly higher slope
for voicing, meaning that the effect of voicing was stronger in his
data. The estimated effect of voicing on vowel duration for PL05 was 14
milliseconds. This observation will come handy when discussing about the
results of the tongue contour data.

\subsection{Tongue contours}\label{tongue-contours}

    \includegraphics[height=.9\textheight]{fig/tra.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison of tongue contours at maximum tongue displacement (within C2 closure) in Italian (top half) and Polish (bottom half). The plotted contours are reference contours for the coronal consonants preceded by /a/. See text for more details.}
    \label{f:tra}
\end{figure*}

Given the poor quality of the ultrasonic data for /u/, this vowel was
not included in the statistical analysis. Significant testing in GAMMs
was achieved through model comparison and visual inspection of the
difference smooth, as suggested in \citep{soskuthy2017}. The analysis of
the Italian ultrasonic data showed that voiced stops are produced with
advancement of the root of the tongue (), as expected based on previous
research on English. Individual GAMMs were fitted for each speaker: the
\textsc{y-coordinates} of the contours were included in the model as the
outcome variable; the \textsc{x-coordinates} as the only parametric
term. The following smooths were specified: a reference smooth term for
the x-coordinates, three difference smooths for the x-coordinates by
\textsc{voicing}, \textsc{vowel quality}, and \textsc{place} of
articulation of the following consonant respectively, and by-word random
smooths. A first-order autoregressive model was included to correct for
the high autocorrelation residuals.

\Cref{f:tra} (top half) shows the predicted tongue contours in voiceless
(red) and voiced stops (blue) at maximum tongue displacement for each
Italian speaker. Below each tongue contour panel, the difference smooth
for voicing is also shown (black line, confidence interval in grey).
Tongue contours are significantly different in those point in which the
confidence interval of the difference smooth does not include 0 on the
ordinate axis. The significantly different portions of the contours are
also indicated in the figures by a shaded red area.

In two participants out of four (IT01, IT02), the root was significantly
more front in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts (/a, o/). On the
other hand, one participant (IT03) had significant tongue root
advancement only following /a/, while the fourth participant (IT04)
didn't show advancement at all. For Polish (bottom half of
\Cref{f:tra}), three out of four speakers (PL02, PL03, PL04) did not
have tongue root advancement, while the fourth speaker (PL05) had
significant advancement in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts.

Further contour analysis was carried out at C2 closure onset for the
Italian and Polish speakers showing advancement. The tongue root at
closure onset was found to be in advanced in voiced consonants ().
Comparisons of tongue contours at C2 onset and at the time of maximum
tongue displacement in voiced consonants further indicated that the
degree of root advancement was larger at maximum displacement for the
Italian speakers (IT01, IT02, IT03), but not for the Polish speaker
(PL05). \Cref{f:voiced} shows the results for IT01 as a representative
example and for PL05.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\label{s:discussion}

Based on the established link between tongue root and voicing, and on
the account by \citet{halle1967}, it was proposed at the beginning of
the paper that the presence of the voicing effect in a language should
be correlated with the presence of tongue root advancement in voiced
stops, if the latter has a link with the durational differences found in
vowels before voiced stops. The hypothesis was that the additional time
required for the tongue to reach an advanced position in voiced stops
could be compensated for during the preceding vowel, thus lengthening in
comparison to vowels followed by voiceless stops. To test the
correlation between tongue root advancement and vowel durations,
ultrasonic data were collected from two languages with and without the
voicing effect, Italian and Polish respectively.

The generalised presence of tongue root advancement in Italian but not
in Polish, as found in the data from this study, provides initial
support to the proposed link between longer vowels following voiced
stops and tongue root advancement. A plausible cause for the longer
duration of vowels before voiced consonants with tongue root advancement
(as in Italian) is that a more complex tongue gesture---a gesture that
requires adjustments of both the tongue root and the tongue
dorsum/tip---requires longer time to be achieved. Protracting the
preceding vocalic gesture in time could then be a solution to allow for
the required additional time. The reported absence of the voicing effect
in Polish could then be ascribed to the absence of tongue root
advancement in the production of voiced consonants in this language.
However, two complications derive from the data presented in this study.
First, tongue root advancement was found in one of the Polish speakers
(PL05) on one hand and it was absent from one of the Italian speakers
(IT04) on the other. Second, vowels followed by voiced stops in Polish
were 8 milliseconds longer in Polish, contrary to what argued in
\citet{keating1984}.

The first issue can be overcome by the observation that, as mentioned
above, PL05 had a strikingly higher slope estimate for the effect of
voicing on vowel duration, compared to the other Polish speakers,
meaning that the voicing effect in his data was
stronger.\footnote{\label{fn:polish-small} Note that excluding PL05 from the durational data produced an estimated difference of vowel duration of 6 milliseconds, which still calls for an explanation. Given the small magnitude of the effect, however, it is likely that such effect is an artefact of the difficulty of segmenting vowel to consonant transitions when the consonant is voiced []. Moreover, such downside would not apply to the data in PL05 given the larger estimates for the effect of voicing and the random slope, as discussed above.}
Incidentally, PL05 is also the only Polish speaker who produced voiced
consonants with an advanced tongue root. Furthermore, a model comparing
tongue root at closure onset versus maximum tongue displacement in PL05
indicated that there was no difference in tongue root advancement at
these two time points (). Assuming the effect in the other Polish
speakers is small enough to be discarded as an artefact (see
\cref{fn:polish-small}), it follows that, independently of the language,
the presence of tongue root advancement in voiced stops correlates with
a concomitant increased duration in vowels preceding voiced consonants.

Given the smaller effect of voicing in PL05 compared to the effect in
Italian (14 vs 19.5 milliseconds), a possible hypothesis could be that
the correlation between tongue root advancement and vowel duration is
gradual, rather then categorical. In this case, the magnitude of the
voicing effect should correlate with the amount of tongue root
advancement even \emph{within speaker}, or at least across speakers
independently of their language. Since the durational difference in the
Polish speaker PL05 was quite small, one expects the magnitude of the
advancement of the root to be proportionately smaller for this speaker.
Future work will set out to investigate the hypothetically gradual
correlation between vowel duration and amount of tongue root
advancement.

Finally, the ultrasonic data showed raising of the tongue dorsum
concomitant to root advancement. The presence of such gesture, although
not expected, makes sense from an anatomical point of view. Raising of
the tongue body could be implemented as a way to counterbalance the
compression of the tongue mass caused by the advancement of the root. It
is not thus surprising to observe a raised tongue body in voiced stops
accompanying root advancement. An alternative account could ascribe
tongue body raising to aerodynamic properties of voiced stops. Since the
intra-oral pressure is higher in voiced stops due to the amount of air
needed to maintain voicing, a firmer seal at the point of oral
constriction could be used to compensate for the increasing pressure.
Expanding the area of contact by raising the tongue body would provide
for such a firmer constriction.

A possible critique to the account proposed here is that, if an active
gesture for maintaining voicing is required during the closure of voiced
stops, then it is not clear how the Polish speakers can maintain voicing
without tongue root advancement. However, root advancement is not the
only solution: manipulations of the larynx or of the velopharyngeal
port, rather than the tongue, can also counterbalance the increased
intra-oral pressure {[}{]}. The gestural timing of the larynx and the
velopharyngeal port are (at least partially) anatomically independent
from the timing of tongue gestures {[}{]}, and would ideally not require
a more complex planning as with an articulatory implementation that of
multiple tongue gestures.
