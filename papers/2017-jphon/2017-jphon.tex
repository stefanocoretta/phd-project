ultrasound study of Italian and Polish}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

It is known that the root of the tongue can play a role in maintaining
voicing during the closure of voiced stop consonants
\citep{halle1967,kent1969,perkell1969,westbury1983}. The production of
vocal fold vibration requires a pressure differential between the
sub-glottal and the supra-glottal cavities (with lower pressure in the
supra-glottal cavity). During the production of voiced obstruents, the
pressure in the supra-glottal cavity quickly increases, due to the
additional air injected from the lungs in the supra-glottal cavity,
which is completely sealed in stops. Such pressure increase can hinder
the ability to maintain voicing during closure, at the point that
voicing can stop if the lowest threshold of pressure differential is
reached and surpassed.

\citet{westbury1983} argues that one way to counterbalance the pressure
increase in the supra-glottal cavity is to enlarge the cavity through
the advancement of the tongue root. Drawing from ultrasound tongue
imaging, \citet{ahn2016} demonstrate that the root of the tongue is
advanced during the articulation of voiced consonants in American
English. They also showed that tongue root advancement is present even
when vocal fold vibration is not implemented during closure in
underlyingly voiced stops. An interesting question arising from the
connection between voicing and tongue root is weather the advancement of
the root is correlated with other phonetic characteristics, like the
duration of vowels preceding stops. Such hypothesis will be expanded on
in this section, after a brief overview of work on the effect of
consonant voicing on vowel duration.

An extensive pool of studies shows that vowels tend to be longer when
followed by voiced obstruents and shorter when followed by voiceless
obstruents \citep[just to mention a
few]{house1953, chen1970, klatt1973, lisker1973}. Most of the literature
on this phenomenon, known as the ``voicing effect'', suggests that
different languages show different magnitudes of such durational
differential, and that in some other languages the duration of vowels is
not affected by the voicing of the following
obstruent.\footnote{For a different opinion on the first matter, see \citet{laeufer1992}.}
Although several attempts have been put forward to explain the effect of
voicing on vowel durations, no consensus has been reached to date.
Nonetheless, a recurrent theme focusses on the differences that
characterise the gestural implementation of voiced and voiceless
stops.\footnote{However, see \citet{javkin1976} and \citet{kluender1988} for two perceptually inclined proposals.}

One of the earliest articulatory accounts of the voicing effect
attributed the difference in vowel duration to the divergent
configuration of the vocal folds between voicing in sonorants and in
obstruents \citetext{\citealp{halle1967}; \citealp[reiterated
in][]{chomsky1968}}. According to \citet{halle1967}, voicing in
obstruents is produced with a state of the glottis that is different
from the configuration necessary to produce vocal fold vibration in
sonorants like vowels. On the contrary, they claim that voiceless stops
do not require any specific glottal configuration and thus the voicing
of the preceding vowel can just naturally ceases at closure (or a few
milliseconds after it). \citet{halle1967} thus hypothesise that, to
allow the glottal state to change from the sonorant voicing of the
preceding vowel to obstruent voicing, the vowel is lengthened so that
enough time is available for such adjustments to happen.

Although such account seemed promising at the time it was proposed,
later studies failed to demonstrate that obstruent voicing is any
different from sonorant voicing {[}{]}. Given the established connection
between voicing and tongue root advancement, the hypothesis follows that
tongue root advancement could also be linked to vowel duration. If this
were the case, a language in which vowels have different durations
depending on the voicing of the following consonant should also show
tongue root advancement in voiced stops, while tongue root advancement
should not be employed in those languages in which vowel durations are
not affected by voicing. Building on the hypothesis in
\citet{halle1967}, I put forward an account in which a relatively more
complex tongue gesture in voiced consonants requires a longer time to be
achieved (\Cref{s:discussion}).

In this paper, I focus on two languages, Italian and Polish, that have
been reported to show and lack the voicing effect respectively. In a
study assessing general properties on segmental durations of spoken
Italian, \citet{farnetani1986} shows that the first vowel in /lada/ is
on average 35 milliseconds longer than the vowel in /lata/ (/lata/ 223
msec, sd = 18; /lada/ 258 msec, sd = 13, p.~26). \citet{esposito2002}
extends Farnetanis's research to all vowels and stops and demonstrates
that vowels are longer when followed by a voiced stop, with an estimate
similar to what reported in \citet{farnetani1986}. On the other hand,
\citet{keating1984} reports that vowels in Polish are not affected by
the voicing of the following consonant. The average duration of the
first vowel in /rata/ is 167.5 milliseconds, while the pre-consonantal
vowel in /rada/ is just two milliseconds longer. Based on the hypothesis
put forward that there is a link between tongue root advancement and the
voicing effect, it is expected that Italian will show tongue root
advancement, while Polish will lack such articulatory gesture in the
implementation of voiced stops.

Eight native speakers of Italian (2 females, 2 males) and Polish (2
females, 2 males) were recorded in Manchester and in Italy
(\Cref{t:participants}). The Italian speakers were from Northern Italy
(three from the Northwest and one from Northeast). The Polish group was
more heterogeneous, with two speakers from the North-west (Poznań), and
two from the North-east (Warsaw and Przasnysz). Ethical clearance was
obtained for this work from the University of Manchester (REF
2016-0099-76). The participants received a small monetary compensation.

\subsection{Equipment set-up}\label{equipment-set-up}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{../../graphics/uti-setup.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic representation of the equipment setup (\citealt{articulate2011}, see text for details).}
    \label{f:uti-setup}
\end{figure*}

An Articulate Instruments Ltd™ set-up was used for this study
(\Cref{f:uti-setup}). The ultrasonic data was collected through a
TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit with a TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic
transducer (20mm radius, 2-4 MHz). A synchronisation unit (P-Stretch)
was plugged into the Echo Blaster unit and used for automatic
audio/ultrasound synchronisation. A FocusRight pre-amplifier and a Movo
LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used for audio recording. The
acquisition of the ultrasonic and audio signals was achieved with the
software Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA, v2.17.2) running on a
Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows 7.
Stabilisation of the ultrasonic transducer was ensured by using a
stabilisation headset produced by Articulate Instruments Ltd™
(\citealt{articulate2008}, not shown in figure).

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}

Disyllabic words of the form
C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2}
were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1}
= /a, o, u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} =
V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/, etc.), yielding a total
of 12 target words. A labial stop was chosen as the first consonant to
reduce influence on the following vowel (although see
\citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007}). Only coronal and velar stops were used
as target consonants since labial consonants cannot be imaged with
ultrasonography. The target words were embedded in a frame sentence.
Prosodically similar sentences were used to ensure comparability between
languages. The frame sentence was \emph{Dico X lentamente} `I say X
slowly' for Italian, and \emph{Mówię X teraz} `I say X now' for Polish.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

The sentences with the target words were randomised for each
participant, although the order was kept the same between repetitions
within participant due to software constraints. Each participant
repeated the list of randomised stimuli six times. The participant's
occlusal plane was obtained using a bite plate \citep{scobbie2011}, and
the hard palate was imaged by asking the participant to swallow water
\citep{epstein2005}. The frame rate of the acquisition of the ultrasonic
data varied between 55 and 65 frames per second (one frame every 15-18
milliseconds). The audio signal was recorded at 22050 MHz (16-bit).

\subsection{Data processing and
analysis}\label{data-processing-and-analysis}

Synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signal was achieved in
post-processing, using a built-in procedure of AAA. The data were then
subject to force alignment using the SPPAS force aligner
\citep{bigi2015}. The outcome of the automatic annotation was then
manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}.
The onset of the target consonant burst (C2 burst) was detected
automatically in Praat \citep{boersma2016}, employing a implementation
of the algorithm described in \citet{ananthapadmanabha2014}. The
durations of the following intervals were then extracted from the
acoustic landmarks using an automated procedure in Praat: vowel duration
(V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant duration (V1 offset to V2 onset), and
closure duration (V1 offset to C2 burst).

Spline curves were automatically fitted to the visible contours using
the AAA batch tracking function. Manual correction was applied in those
cases that showed clear tracking errors. The time of maximum tongue
displacement within consonant closure was then calculated in AAA
following the method in \citet{strycharczuk2015}. Fan line selection in
this study was achieved by finding the fan line within the relevant area
of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for
velar consonants) with the highest standard deviation of displacement.
Tongue contours were exported in Cartesian coordinates at two time
points: (1) at the onset of C2 closure, and (2) at maximum tongue
displacement (within C2 closure). The contours were normalised by
applying offsetting and rotation relative to the participant's occlusal
plane \citep{scobbie2011}.

Durational measurements were analysed using linear mixed effects models
using \texttt{lme4} in R \citep{r-core-team2017, bates2015}. Generalised
additive mixed effects regression models \citep[GAMMs,][]{wood2006} were
used for the statistical analysis of tongue contour data.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Vowel duration and
voicing}\label{vowel-duration-and-voicing}

A linear mixed effects regression model was fitted to the Italian vowel
duration data with \textsc{duration} as the outcome variable;
\textsc{vowel quality} (/a, o, u/), \textsc{voicing} and
\textsc{place of articulation} of the following consonant,
\textsc{sentence duration} as fixed effects; random intercepts by
speaker and word, and by-speaker random slopes for voicing. An
interaction between voicing and vowel quality was also included in the
final model, since it significantly improved the model. P-values were
obtained through likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model
including voicing with a null model without voicing as a predictor.
According to the full model, Italian vowels are 19.5 milliseconds (SE =
5.5) longer if followed by a voiced stop (\(\chi^2\)(3) = 18.5, p
\textless{} 0.001).

For Polish, the same model structure was used, excluding the
voicing-vowel interaction (which was not significant). Contrary to
previous findings, the model reveals a partially significant 8
milliseconds (SE = 3) effect of consonantal voicing on the preceding
vowel (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 5.4, p = 0.02). The exploration of the random
slopes for each speaker indicated that PL05 showed a particularly higher
slope for voicing, meaning that the effect of voicing was stronger in
his data, but removing this speaker from the model doesn't remove the
effect. The estimated effect of voicing on vowel duration for PL05 was
14 milliseconds. These observations will become relevant when discussing
about the results of the tongue contour data.

\subsection{Tongue contours}\label{tongue-contours}

\label{s:splines}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=.9\textheight]{fig/tra.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison of tongue contours at maximum tongue displacement (within C2 closure) in Italian (top half) and Polish (bottom half). The plotted contours are reference contours for the coronal consonants preceded by /a/. See \Cref{s:splines} for more details.}
    \label{f:tra}
\end{figure*}

The tongue contour data were analysed with GAMMs \citep{wood2006}.
Individual GAMMs were fitted for each speaker: the
\textsc{y-coordinates} of the contours were included in the model as the
outcome variable; the \textsc{x-coordinates} as the only parametric
term. The following smooths were specified: a reference smooth term for
the x-coordinates, three difference smooths for the x-coordinates by
\textsc{voicing}, \textsc{vowel quality}, and \textsc{place} of
articulation of the following consonant respectively, and
\textsc{by-word} random smooths. A first-order autoregressive model was
included to correct for the high autocorrelation residuals. Significance
testing in GAMMs was achieved through model comparison and visual
inspection of the difference smooth, as suggested in
\citep{soskuthy2017}. Given the poor quality of the ultrasonic data for
/u/, this vowel was not included in the statistical analysis of tongue
contours, hence the results reported in this section only refer to /a/
and /o/.

The analysis of the Italian ultrasonic data shows that voiced stops are
produced with advancement of the root of the tongue (), as expected
based on previous research on English. \Cref{f:tra} (top half) shows the
predicted tongue contours in voiceless (red) and voiced stops (blue) at
maximum tongue displacement for each Italian speaker. Below each tongue
contour panel, the difference smooth for voicing is also shown (black
line, confidence interval in grey). Tongue contours are significantly
different in those point in which the confidence interval of the
difference smooth does not include 0 on the ordinate axis. The
significantly different portions of the contours are also indicated in
the figures by a shaded red area.

In two participants out of four (IT01, IT02), the root was significantly
more front in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts (/a, o/). On the
other hand, one participant (IT03) had significant tongue root
advancement only following /a/, while the fourth participant (IT04)
didn't show advancement at all. For Polish (bottom half of
\Cref{f:tra}), three out of four speakers (PL02, PL03, PL04) did not
have tongue root advancement, while the fourth speaker (PL05) had
significant advancement in voiced stops in both vocalic contexts.

Further contour analysis was carried out at C2 closure onset for the
Italian and Polish speakers showing advancement. The tongue root at
closure onset was found to be in advanced in voiced consonants ().
Comparisons of tongue contours at C2 onset and at the time of maximum
tongue displacement in voiced consonants further indicated that the
degree of root advancement was larger at maximum displacement for the
Italian speakers (IT01, IT02, IT03), but not for the Polish speaker
(PL05). \Cref{f:voiced} shows the results for IT01 as a representative
example and for PL05.

\end{figure*}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\label{s:discussion}

Based on the established link between tongue root and voicing, it was
proposed at the beginning of the paper that the presence of the voicing
effect in a language should be correlated with the presence of tongue
root advancement in voiced stops. To test the correlation between tongue
root advancement and vowel durations, ultrasonic data were collected
from two languages with and without the voicing effect, Italian and
Polish respectively. The data from most speakers pattern according to
the hypothesis that a link subsists between longer vowels following
voiced stops and tongue root advancement in that type of consonants.

Following the reasoning of the proposal by \citet{halle1967}, a
plausible cause for the longer duration of vowels before voiced
consonants with tongue root advancement (as in Italian) could therefore
be the additional time required to achieve a more complex consonantal
gesture---a gesture that requires adjustments of both the tongue root
and the tongue dorsum/tip. The reported absence of the voicing effect in
Polish could then be ascribed to the absence of tongue root advancement
in the production of voiced consonants in this language. Complications
arise from the fact that we do find a small but significant vowel
duration difference in Polish, and therefore cannot claim that the
voicing effect is entirely absent from Polish, in contrast to previous
findings by \citet{keating1984}. Moreover, tongue root advancement was
found in one of the Polish speakers on one hand (PL05), and it was
absent from one of the Italian speakers on the other (IT04).

It is noteworthy that, as mentioned above, PL05 had a strikingly higher
slope estimate for the effect of voicing on vowel duration, compared to
the other Polish speakers, meaning that the voicing effect in his data
was
stronger.\footnote{\label{fn:polish-small} Note that excluding PL05 from the durational data produced an estimated difference of vowel duration of 6 milliseconds, which still calls for an explanation. Given the small magnitude of the effect, however, it is likely that such effect is an artefact of the difficulty of segmenting vowel to consonant transitions when the consonant is voiced [@allen1978]. Moreover, such downside would not apply to the data in PL05 given the larger estimates for the effect of voicing and the random slope, as discussed above.}
Incidentally, PL05 is also the only Polish speaker who produced voiced
consonants with an advanced tongue root. Furthermore, a model comparing
tongue root at closure onset versus maximum tongue displacement in PL05
indicated that there was no difference in tongue root advancement at
these two time points (). Assuming the effect in the other Polish
speakers is small enough to be discarded as an artefact (see
\cref{fn:polish-small}), it follows that, independently of the language,
the presence of tongue root advancement in voiced stops correlates with
a concomitant increased duration in vowels preceding voiced consonants.

Given the smaller effect of voicing in PL05 compared to the effect in
Italian (14 vs 19.5 milliseconds), a possible hypothesis could be that
the correlation between tongue root advancement and vowel duration is
gradual, rather then categorical. In this case, the magnitude of the
voicing effect should correlate with the amount of tongue root
advancement even \emph{within speaker}, or at least across speakers
independently of their language. Since the durational difference in the
Polish speaker PL05 was quite small, one expects the magnitude of the
advancement of the root to be proportionately smaller for this speaker.
Future work will set out to investigate the hypothetically gradient
correlation between vowel duration and amount of tongue root
advancement.

In addition to tongue root advancement, the ultrasonic data also showed
raising of the tongue dorsum. The presence of such gesture, although not
expected, makes sense from an anatomical point of view. Raising of the
tongue body could be implemented as a way to counterbalance the
compression of the tongue mass caused by the advancement of the root. It
is not thus surprising to observe a raised tongue body in voiced stops
accompanying root advancement. An alternative account could ascribe
tongue body raising to aerodynamic properties of voiced stops. Since the
intra-oral pressure is higher in voiced stops due to the amount of air
needed to maintain voicing, a firmer seal at the point of oral
constriction could be used to compensate for the increasing pressure.
Expanding the area of contact by raising the tongue body would provide
for such a firmer constriction.

A possible critique to the account proposed here is that, if an active
gesture for maintaining voicing is required during the closure of voiced
stops, then it is not clear how the Polish speakers can maintain voicing
without tongue root advancement. However, root advancement is not the
only solution: manipulations of the larynx or of the velopharyngeal
port, rather than the tongue, can also counterbalance the increased
intra-oral pressure {[}{]}. The gestural timing of the larynx and the
velopharyngeal port are (at least partially) anatomically independent
from the timing of tongue gestures {[}{]}, and would ideally not require
a more complex planning as with an articulatory implementation of
multiple tongue gestures.
