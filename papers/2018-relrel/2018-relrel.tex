\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\label{s:intro}

Almost a hundred years of research have consistently shown that
consonantal voicing has an effect on preceding vowel duration: vowels
followed by voiced obstruents are longer than when followed by voiceless
ones (\citealt{meyer1904}; \citealt{heffner1937}; \citealt{house1953};
\citealt{belasco1953}; \citealt{peterson1960}; \citealt{halle1967};
\citealt{chen1970}; \citealt{klatt1973}; \citealt{lisker1974};
\citealt{laeufer1992}; \citealt{fowler1992}; \citealt{hussein1994};
\citealt{lampp2004}; \citealt{warren2005}; \citealt{durvasula2012}).
This so called `voicing effect' has been found in a considerable variety
of languages, including (but not limited to) English, German, Hindi,
Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Korean (see \citealt{maddieson1976} for a
more comprehensive, but still not exhaustive list). Despite of the
plethora of evidence in support of the \emph{existence} of the voicing
effect, agreement hasn't been reached regarding its
\emph{source}.\footnote{Here, I take 'source' as a general term without any particular theoretical commitment to whether it should be intended as a strictly synchronic or diachronic cause.
}

Several proposals have been put forward in relation to the possible
source of the voicing effect (see \citealt{soskuthy2013} and
\citealt{begus2017} for an overview). The majority of the proposed
accounts place the source of the voicing effect in properties of speech
production.\footnote{Two accounts that posit a perceptual cause are \citet{javkin1976} and \citet{kluender1988}. To the best of my knowledge, Javkin's (1976) proposal remains to be empirically tested, while see \citet{fowler1992} for arguments against \citet{kluender1988}.}
A notable production account, which will be the focus of this study, is
the compensatory temporal adjustment account
\citep{lindblom1967, slis1969a, slis1969, lehiste1970, lehiste1970a}.
According to this account, the voicing effect follows from the
reorganisation of gestures within a unit of speech that is not affected
by stop voicing. The duration of such unit is held constant across
voicing contexts, while the duration of voiceless and voiced obstruents
differs. The closure of voiceless stops is longer than that of voiced
stops \citep{lisker1957, van-summers1987, davis1989, de-jong1991}. As a
consequence, vowels followed by voiceless stops (which have a long
closure) are shorter than vowels followed by voiced stops (which have a
short closure). Advocates of the compensatory account propose two
prosodic units as the scope of the temporal adjustment: the syllable
(or, more neutrally, the VC sequence, \citealt{lindblom1967}), and the
word \citep{slis1969a, slis1969, lehiste1970, lehiste1970a}. However,
the compensatory temporal adjustment account has been criticised in
subsequent work.

Empirical evidence and logic challenge the proposal that the syllable or
the word have a constant duration and hence drive compensation. First,
Lindblom's \citeyear{lindblom1967} argument that the duration of the
syllable is constant is not supported by the findings in
\citet{chen1970} and \citet{jacewicz2009}. \citet{chen1970} rejects a
syllable-based compensatory account in the light of the fact that the
duration of the syllable is affected by consonant voicing.
\citet{jacewicz2009} further show that the duration of monosyllabic
words in American English changes depending on the voicing of the coda
consonant. Second, although the results in \citet{slis1969} suggest that
the duration of disyllabic words in Dutch is constant whether the second
stop is voiceless or voiced, it does not follow from this fact that
compensation should necessarily target the vowel preceding the stop.
Indeed, it is logically possible that the following unstressed vowel
could be the target of the compensation, therefore differences in
preceding vowel duration still call for an explanation.

The compensatory temporal adjustment account has been further challenged
on the basis of the so called `aspiration effect' \citep{maddieson1976},
by which vowels are longer when followed by aspirated stops than when
followed by unaspirated stops. In Hindi, vowels before voiceless
unaspirated stops are the shortest, followed by vowels before voiced
unaspirated and voiceless aspirated stops, which have similar duration,
followed by vowels before voiced aspirated stops, which are the longest.
\citet{maddieson1976} find no compensatory pattern between vowel and
consonant duration: the consonant /t/, which has the shortest duration,
is preceded by the shortest vowel, and vowels before /d/ and /tʰ/ have
the same duration although the durations of the two consonants are
different. \citet{maddieson1976} argue that a compensatory explanation
for differences in vowel duration cannot be maintained.

However, a re-evaluation of the way consonant duration is measured in
\citet{maddieson1976} might actually turn their findings in favour of a
compensatory account. Due to difficulties in detecting the release of
the consonant of interest, consonant duration in \citet{maddieson1976}
is measured from the closure of the relevant consonant to the release of
the following, (e.g., in \emph{ab sāth kaho}, the duration of /tʰ/ in
\emph{sāth} is calculated as the interval between the closure of /tʰ/
and the release of /k/). This measure includes the burst and aspiration
(if present) of the consonant following the target vowel.
\citet{slis1969a}, however, state that the inverse relation between
vowel duration and the following consonant applies to \emph{closure}
duration, and not to the entire \emph{consonant}
duration.\footnote{In this paper, I use the term *relation* to mean a categorical pattern of entailment (like in 'a long vowel entails a short closure'), while the term *correlation* is reserved to a statistical correlation of two continuous variables.)}
If a correlation exists between vowel and closure duration, the
inclusion of burst and/or aspiration clearly alters this relationship.

Indeed, the study on Hindi voicing and aspiration effects conducted by
\citet{durvasula2012} indicates that closure duration, measured from
closure onset to closure offset, decreases according to the hierarchy
voiceless unaspirated \textgreater{} voiced unaspirated \textgreater{}
voiceless aspirated \textgreater{} voiced aspirated, which closely
resembles the order of increasing vowel duration in
\citet{maddieson1976}. Nonetheless, \citet{durvasula2012} do not find a
negative correlation between vowel duration and consonant closure
duration, but rather a (small) \emph{positive effect}. Vowel duration
increases with closure duration when voicing and aspiration are taken
into account. However, as noted in \citet{begus2017}, it is likely that
this result is a consequence of not controlling for speech rate. A small
negative effect of closure duration can turn positive if the effect of
speech rate (which is positive) is greater, given the cumulative nature
of these effects \citep[p. 2177]{begus2017}.

\citet{de-jong1991} finds partial support to a compensatory mechanism
between vowel and closure duration in an electro-magneto-articulometric
study of two American English speakers. The duration of vowels in
nuclear accented, pre-, and post-nuclear accented position is weakly
negatively correlated with closure duration (the slope coefficients
range between -0.12 and -0.35, meaning that the amount of durational
compensation is between 10\% and 35\%). Although it is difficult to draw
definite conclusions based on the data of two speakers, and while the
magnitude of the correlation is quite weak to univocally support
compensation, the direction of the correlation is correct (i.e.~a
negative correlation).

Further evidence for a compensatory account and a negative correlation
between vowel and closure duration comes from the effect of a third type
of consonants, namely ejectives. \citet{begus2017} finds that in
Georgian (which contrasts aspirated, voiced, and ejective consonants)
vowels are short when followed by voiceless aspirated stops, longer
before ejective stops, and longest when followed by voiced stops.
Crucially, stop closure duration follows the reversed pattern: closure
duration is short in voiced stops, longer in ejectives, and longest in
voiceless aspirated stops. Moreover, vowel duration is inversely
correlated with closure duration across the three phonation
types.\footnote{\citet{begus2017} mentions the possibility that the negative correlation is an artefact of the fact that vowel and closure durations always share a boundary. This annotation bias could generate negative correlations (by which the vowel would shorten when, for example, the boundary is placed to the left of the 'actual' boundary). However, Beguš shows with a cross-annotator analysis that this was not the case with his data. Moreover, I would like to add that, if misplacement of the V-C boundary is due to random error (which is the safest assumption), the measured displacement from the 'actual' boundary will follow (approximately) a normal distribution with mean 0. This statistical reasoning, however, applies only in the case where misplacement is indeed random, and not biased (towards one particular side).}
\citet{begus2017} argues that these findings support a temporal
compensation account (although not univocally, see
\citealt[Section V]{begus2017}).

To summarise, a compensatory temporal adjustment account has been
proposed to explain the voicing effect. According to such account, the
difference in vowel duration before consonants varying in voicing (and
possibly other phonation types) is the outcome of a compensation between
vowel and closure duration. After a careful review of the critiques
advanced by \citet{chen1970} and \citet{maddieson1976}, and in face of
the results in \citet{slis1969}, \citet{de-jong1991} and
\citet{begus2017}, a compensatory account gains credibility. However,
issues about the actual implementation of the compensation mechanism
still remain. In conclusion, while the compensatory temporal adjustment
account is plausible on the light of the reviewed literature, we are
left with the necessity of finding a constant speech interval within
which compensation is logically implemented.

\subsection{The present study}\label{the-present-study}}

This paper reports on selected results from a broader exploratory study
that investigates the relationship between vowel duration and consonant
voicing from both an acoustic and articulatory perspective. Synchronised
recordings of audio, ultrasound tongue imaging, and electroglottography
were carried out to enable a data-driven approach to the analysis of
features related to the voicing effect in the context of disyllabic
(CV́CV) words in Italian and
Polish.\footnote{As per \citet{cysouw2013}, the glossonyms \textit{Italian} and \textit{Polish} as used here to refer, respectively, to the languoids Italian [\textsc{Glottocode}: \texttt{ital1282}] and Polish [\textsc{Glottocode}: \texttt{poli1260}].}
Given its exploratory nature, this study was not devised to test the
compensatory account, but rather to collect articulatory and acoustic
data on the voicing effect. Moreover, the design of the study has been
constrained by the use of such articulatory techniques (see
\Cref{s:method}). Since the tongue imaging and electroglottographic data
don't bear on the main argument put forward here, only the results from
acoustics will be discussed.

Italian and Polish reportedly differ in the magnitude (or presence) of
the effect of stop voicing on vowel duration, while they are both
classified as voicing languages (languages in which the laryngeal
opposition in consonants is between voiceless unaspirated and voiced
consonants,
\citealt{beckman2013}).\footnote{The distinction between voicing and aspirating varieties of Polish discussed in @cyran2011 is based on phonological considerations rather than empirical data on VOT duration.
% Cite Waniek 2011
} For this reason, these two language offer the opportunity to
investigate differences that could reveal mechanisms underlying the
voicing effect. Moreover, given that Italian and Polish share---on a
general level---some features of the segmental and prosodic make-up of
their phonological systems, the design of the experimental material and
comparison of the results is facilitated.

Italian has been unanimously reported as a voicing-effect language
\citep{caldognetto1979, farnetani1986, esposito2002}. The mean
difference in vowel duration when followed by voiceless vs.~voiced
consonants ranges between 22 and 24 ms in these studies, with longer
vowels followed by voiced consonants. The mean differences are based on
3 speakers in \citealt{farnetani1986} and 7 speakers in
\citealt{esposito2002}. \citealt{caldognetto1979} does not report
estimates of vowel duration, just the direction of the effect, but the
study is based on 10 speakers. On the other hand, the results regarding
the presence and magnitude of the effect in Polish are mixed. While
\citet{keating1984} reports no effect of voicing on vowel duration in
data from 24 speakers, \citet{nowak2006} finds that vowels followed by
voiced stops are 4.5 ms longer in the 4 speakers recorded.
\citet{malisz2008} argue based on data from 40 speakers that the
magnitude of the voicing effect in Polish is highly idiosyncratic, and
claim their results are inconclusive on this
matter.\footnote{Note that while Polish neutralises the voicing contrast word-finally, it is maintained word-medially.}
While they do not report estimates from the 40 speakers, a table with
mean vowel durations from 4 speakers suggest a mean difference before
voiceless vs.~voiced stops of 3.5 ms.

The acoustic data from the exploratory study discussed here suggests the
existence of a voicing effect both in Italian and Polish, and that the
duration of the interval between two consecutive stop releases (the
Release to Release interval) is not affected by the voicing of the
second consonant in both languages. This finding is compatible with a
compensatory temporal adjustment account by which the timing of the stop
closure onset within said interval determines the respective durations
of vowel and closure. I further propose that the constant duration of
the Release to Release interval is congruent with current views on
gestural timing \citep{goldstein2014} and I discuss the insights such an
account provides in relation to our understanding of the gestural
organisation of speech.

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

For this exploratory study, we set a target of 10 speakers per
language.\footnote{A low target number of participants was chosen since processing of ultrasound data takes longer than standard acoustic analysis.
} The stopping rule was to reach 10 speakers in both languages or to end
data collection within 15 months from the start, due to resource and
time limits. Participants were sought in Manchester, UK, and in
Verbania, Italy. Seventeen subjects in total participated in this study.
Eleven subjects are native speakers of Italian (5 female, 6 male), while
six are native speakers of Polish (3 female, 3 male). The Italian
speakers are from the North and Centre of Italy (8 speakers from
Northern Italy, 3 from Central Italy). The Polish group has 2 speakers
from Western Poland, 3 speakers from Central Poland, and 1 speaker from
Eastern Poland. For more information on the sociolinguistic details of
the speakers, see \Cref{a:socioling}. Ethical clearance for this study
was obtained from the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76). The
participants signed a written consent and received a monetary
compensation of £10.

\hypertarget{equipment}{%
\subsection{Equipment}\label{equipment}}

The acquisition of the audio signal was achieved with the software
Articulate Assistant Advanced™ (AAA, v2.17.2, \citealt{articulate2011})
running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows
7. Audio recordings were sampled at 22050 Hz (16-bit), in a proprietary
format (\texttt{.aa0}). A FocusRight Scarlett Solo pre-amplifier and a
Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used for audio recording. The
microphone was placed at the level of the participant's mouth on one
side, at a distance of about 10
cm.\footnote{The microphone was clipped onto a metal headset wore by the participant, which is part of the ultrasound equipment.}

\label{s:materials}

The target stimuli were disyllabic words with
C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2}
structure, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o,
u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} =
V\textsubscript{1} (e.g.~/pata/, /pada/, /poto/,
etc.).\footnote{Italian has both a mid-low [ɔ] and a mid-high [o] back vowel in its vowel inventory. These vowels are traditionally described as two distinct phonemes \citep{kramer2009}, although both their phonemic status and their phonetic substance are subject to a high degree of geographical and idiosyncratic variability \citep{renwick2016}. As a rule of thumb, stressed open syllables in Italian (like the ones used in this study) have [ɔː] (vowels in penultimate stressed open syllables are long) rather than [oː] \citep{renwick2016}. On the other hand, Polish has only a mid-low back vowel phoneme /ɔ/ \citep{gussmann2007}. For sake of typographical simplicity, the symbol /o/ will be used here for both languages.}
Most are nonce words, although inevitably some combinations produce real
words both in Italian (4 words) and Polish (2 words, see
\Cref{a:targets}). The lexical stress of the target words was placed by
speakers of both Italian and Polish on V\textsubscript{1}, as intended.

The make-up of the target words was constrained by the design of the
experiment, which included ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI). Front vowels
are difficult to image with UTI, since their articulation involves
tongue positions which are particularly far from the ultrasonic probe,
hence reducing the visibility of the tongue contour. For this reason,
only central and back vowels were included. Since one of the variables
of interest in the exploratory study was the closing gesture of
C\textsubscript{2}, only lingual consonants were used. A labial stop was
chosen as the first consonant to reduce possible coarticulation with the
following vowel (although see \citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007}). The number
of target words was kept low to reduce the time required for completing
the
task.\footnote{The ultrasonic equipment usually gets uncomfortable when wore for more than 20 minutes.
}

The target words were embedded in a frame sentence. Controlling for
meaning, segmental and prosodic make-up betweeen languages proved to be
difficult. The frames are \emph{Dico X lentamente} `I say X slowly' in
Italian \citep[following][]{hajek2008}, and \emph{Mówię X teraz} `I say
X now' in Polish, and presented according to the respective writing
conventions. These sentences were chosen in order to keep the placement
of focus similar across languages (on the target word). Possible
influences of the semantic content of the frame sentence on duration
estimates will be discussed in \Cref{s:discussion}.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

The participant was asked to read the sentences with the target words
which were sequentially presented on the computer screen. The order of
the sentences was randomised for each participant. Participants read the
list of randomised sentence stimuli 6 times. Due to software
constraints, the order of the list was kept the same across the six
repetitions within each participant. The reading task lasted between 15
and 20 minutes, with optional short breaks between one repetition and
the other. The total experiment time lasted around 45 minutes. Each
speaker read a total of 12 sentences for 6 times (with the exceptions of
IT02, who repeated the 12 sentences 5 times), which yields to a grand
total of 1212 tokens (792 from Italian, 420 from
Polish).\footnote{IT01 and IT02 (the first two participants of this study) also read sentences with words starting with /b/, which were later excluded from the experimental design. The data from /b/-initial words are not included in the analysis reported in this paper.}

The experiment was carried out in two locations: in the sound attenuated
booth of the Phonetics Laboratory at the University of Manchester, and
in a quiet room in a field location in Italy (Verbania, Northern Italy).
In both locations the equipment and procedures were the same. Data
collection started in December 2016 and ended in March 2018.

The audio recordings were exported from AAA in the \texttt{.wav} format
at the same sample and bit rate for further processing. A forced aligned
transcription was accomplished through the SPeech Phonetisation
Alignment and Syllabification software (SPPAS) \citep{bigi2015}. The
outcome of the automatic annotation was manually corrected for the
relevant boundaries, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}
based on \citet{machac2009}. Segmentation boundaries not used in the
analyses have not been checked to speed up processing. The releases of
C1 and C2 were detected automatically by means of a Praat scripting
implementation of the algorithm described in
\citet{ananthapadmanabha2014}, and subsequently corrected if necessary.
The identification of the stop release was not possible in 99 tokens
(8\%) of C1 and 265 tokens (22\%) of C2 out of 1212. This was due either
to the absence of a clear burst in the waveform and spectrogram, or the
realisation of voiced stops as voiced fricatives Most of the
fricativised tokens come from the three speakers of Central Italian,
IT12, IT13, and IT14, a variety of Italian known to show this phenomenon
\citealt{hualde2011}. Moreover IT12 and IT14 produced several tokens of
voiceless stops with voicing during closure (in some cases the closure
is completely voiced). These tokens have been kept in the analysis,
because (1) the actual presence or absence of voicing during closure
does not bear on the compensatory account discussed here (which concerns
supraglottal gestures) and laryngeal gestures can be implemented almost
entirely independently from oral gestures, and (2) the voicing effect
has been shown to exist even in whispered speech, where vocal fold
vibration is entirely absent \citep{sharf1964}.

The durations in milliseconds of the following intervals were extracted
with Praat scripting from the annotated acoustic landmarks: word
duration, vowel duration (V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant closure
duration (V1 offset to C2 release), and Release to Release duration (C1
release to C2 release). Sentence duration was measured in seconds.
\Cref{f:segmentation} shows an example of the segmentation of /pata/ (a)
and /pada/ (b) from an Italian speaker. Syllable rate (syllables per
second) was used as a proxy to speech rate \citep{plug2018}, and was
calculated as the number of syllables divided by the duration of the
sentence in seconds (8 syllables in Italian, 6 in Polish). All further
data processing and visualisation was done in R v3.5.0
\citep{r-core-team2018, wickham2017}.

Given the data-driven nature of the study, all statistical analyses
reported here are to be considered exploratory (hypothesis-generating)
rather than confirmatory (hypothesis-driven)
\citep{kerr1998, gelman2013, roettger2018}. The durational measurements
were analysed with linear mixed-effects models using \texttt{lme4}
v1.1-17 in R \citep{bates2015}, and model estimates were extracted with
the \texttt{effects} package v4.0-2 \citep{fox2003}. All factors were
coded with treatment contrasts and the following reference levels:
voiceless (vs.~voiced), /a/ (vs.~/o/, /u/), coronal (vs.~velar), Italian
(vs.~Polish). The models were fitted by Restricted Maximum Likelihood
estimation (REML). The estimates in the results section refer to these
reference levels unless interactions are discussed. \emph{P}-values for
the individual terms were obtained with \texttt{lmerTest} v3.0-1, which
uses the Satterthwaite's approximation to degrees of freedom
\citep{kuznetsova2017, luke2017}. A result is considered significant if
the \emph{p}-value is below the alpha level
(\(\alpha = 0.05\)).\footnote{\citet{luke2017} argues that the common approach of using likelihood ratio tests for statistical inference with mixed models leads to inflated Type I error rates. \citet[1501]{luke2017} also warns that `results should be interpreted with caution, regardless of the method adopted for obtaining \textit{p}-values'.}

Bayes factors were used to specifically test the null hypotheses that
word and Release to Release duration are not affected by C2 voicing
(i.e., the effect of C2 voicing on duration is \texttt{0}). For each set
of null/alternative hypotheses, a full model (with the predictor of
interest) and a null model (excluding it) were fitted separately using
the Maximum Likelihood estimation (ML) \citep[p.~34]{bates2015}. The
Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) approximation was then used to obtain
Bayes factors
\citep{raftery1995, raftery1999, wagenmakers2007, jarosz2014}. The
approximation is calculated according to the equation in \ref{eq:bayes}
\citep[p.~796]{wagenmakers2007}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayes}
BF_{01} \approx exp(\Delta{}BIC_{10}/2)
\end{equation}

where \(\Delta{}BIC_{10} = BIC_1 - BIC_0\), \(BIC_1\) is the BIC of the
full model, and \(BIC_0\) is the BIC of the null model. Values of
\(BF_{01} > 1\) indicate a preference of H\textsubscript{0} over
H\textsubscript{1}. The interpretation of the Bayes factors follows the
recommendations in \citet[p.~139]{raftery1995}: 1--3 = weak evidence,
3--20 = positive evidence, 20--150 = strong evidence, \textgreater{} 150
= very strong evidence.

The extracted measurements were filtered before statistical analysis.
Measures of vowel duration, closure duration, word duration, and Release
to Release duration that are 3 standard deviations lower or higher than
the respective means were excluded from the final dataset (this
procedure generally corresponds to a loss of around 2.5\% of the data).
One sentence (sentence 48 of IT07, \emph{Dico pada lentamente}) included
a speech error and has been excluded. Further excluding missing
measurements, these operations yields a total of 920 tokens of vowel and
closure durations, 1176 tokens of word duration, and 848 tokens of
Release to Release duration.

While the study has been devised to compare Italian and Polish, the low
number of Polish speaker (6, especially compared with the number of
Italian speakers 11), makes statistical comparison difficult (see
\citealt{kirby2018} and references therein for a discussion on
statistical power). The raw mean differences, presented in conjunction
with the estimates from statistical modelling, can still inform us on
the cross-linguistic differences and thus they will contribute to the
discussion of the results.

\end{figure}

\Cref{f:Figure2} shows boxplots and raw data of vowel duration for the
three vowels /a, o, u/ when followed by voiceless or voiced stops in
Italian and Polish. Vowel tend to be longer when followed by a voiced
stop in both languages. The effect appears to be greater in Italian than
in Polish, especially for the vowels /a/ and /o/. There is no evident
effect of C2 voicing in /u/ in Italian, but the effect is discernible in
Polish /u/. In Italian, vowels have a mean duration of 106.16 ms (SD =
27.08) before voiceless stops, and a mean duration of 117.66 ms (SD =
34.63) before voiced stops. Polish vowels are on average 75.57 ms long
(SD = 16.16) when followed by a voiceless stop, and 83.11 ms long (SD =
19.37) if a voiced stop follows. The difference in vowel duration based
on the raw means is 11.5 ms in Italian and 7.54 ms in Polish.

A linear mixed-effects model with vowel duration as the outcome variable
was fitted with the following predictors: fixed effects for C2 voicing
(voiceless, voiced), C2 place of articulation (coronal, velar), vowel
(a, o, u), language (Italian, Polish), and speech rate (as syllables per
second); by-speaker and by-word random intercepts with by-speaker random
slopes for C2 voicing. All possible interactions between C2 voicing,
vowel, and language were included. The following terms are significant
according to \emph{t}-tests with Satterthwaite's approximation to
degrees of freedom: C2 voicing, vowel, language, and speech rate. Only
the interaction between C2 voicing and vowel is significant. Vowels are
16.28 ms longer (SE = 4.42) when followed by a voiced stop (C2 voicing).
The effect of C2 voicing is smaller with /u/ (around 3 ms,
\(\hat{\beta}\) = -13.1 ms, SE = 5.56). Polish has on average shorter
vowels than Italian (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -24.05 ms, SE = 7.83), and the
effect of voicing is estimated to be about 10.55 ms (although note that
the interaction between language and C2 voicing is not significant).
Speech rate has a negative effect on vowel duration, such that faster
rates correlate with shorter vowel durations (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -16.23
ms, SE = 1.26).

\end{figure}

\Cref{f:Figure3} illustrates stop closure durations with boxplots and
individual raw data points. A pattern opposite to that with vowel
duration can be noticed: closure duration is shorter for voiced than for
voiceless stops. The closure of voiceless stops in Italian is 106.16 ms
long (SD = 27.08), while the voiced stops have a mean closure duration
of 117.66 ms (SD = 34.63). In Polish, the closure duration is 75.57 ms
(SD = 16.16) in voiceless stops and 83.11 ms (SD = 19.37) in voiced
stops. The difference in closure duration based on the raw means is
13.33 ms in Italian and 10.87 ms in Polish. The same model specification
as with vowel duration has been fitted with consonant closure duration
as the outcome variable. C2 voicing, C2 place, and speech rate are
significant. Stop closure is 16.5 ms shorter (SE = 3) if the stop is
voiced and 3.5 ms longer (SE = 1.5) if velar. Finally, faster speech
rates correlate with shorter closure durations (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -8.5
ms, SE = 1 ms).

\end{figure}

A model addressing the relationship between vowel and stop closure
duration was fitted with the following terms and interactions: vowel
duration as the outcome variable; as fixed effects, closure duration,
vowel, speech rate; an interaction between closure duration and vowel;
by-speaker and by-word random intercepts, and by-speaker random slopes
for C2 voicing. Closure duration has a significant effect on vowel
duration (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -0.15 ms, SE = 0.06 ms). The effect with /u/
is greater than with /a/ and /o/ (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -0.35 ms, SE = 0.06
ms). In general, closure duration is inversely proportional to vowel
duration. However, such correlation is quite weak, as shown by the small
estimates. A 1 ms increase in closure duration corresponds to a 0.2--0.5
ms decrease in vowel duration. \Cref{f:Figure4} shows for each vowel /a,
o, u/ the individual data points and the regression lines with
confidence intervals extracted from the mixed-effects model.

\hypertarget{word-duration}{%
\subsection{Word duration}\label{word-duration}}

Words with a voiceless C2 are on average 397 ms long (SD = 81) in
Italian and 356 ms long (SD = 39) in Polish. Words with a voiced stop
have a mean duration of 396 ms (SD = 72) in Italian and 362 ms (SD = 39)
in Polish. The following full and null models were fitted to test the
effect of C2 voicing on word duration. The full model is made up of the
following fixed effects: C2 voicing, C2 place, vowel, language, and
speech rate. The model also includes by-speaker and by-word random
intercepts, and a by-speaker random slope for C2 voicing. The null model
is the same as the full model with the exclusion of the fixed effect of
C2 voicing. The Bayes factor of the null against the full model is 19.
Thus, the null model (in which there is no effect of C2 voicing,
\(\beta\) = 0) is 19 times more likely under the observed data than the
full model. This indicates that there is positive evidence for a null
effect of C2 voicing on word duration.

\end{figure}

In \Cref{f:Figure5}, boxplots and raw data points show the duration of
the Release to Release interval in words with a voiceless vs.~a voiced
C2 stop, in Italian and Polish. It can be seen that the distributions,
medians, and quartiles of the durations in the voiceless and voiced
condition do not differ much in either language. In Italian, the mean
duration of the Release to Release interval is 210 ms (SD = 44) if C2 is
voiceless, and 209 ms (SD = 41) if voiced. In Polish, the mean durations
are respectively 173 (SD = 22) and 172 (SD = 21) ms. The specifications
of the null and full models for the Release to Release duration are the
same as for word duration. The Bayes factor of the null model against
the full model is 21, which means that the null model (without C2
voicing) is 21 times more likely than the model with C2 voicing as a
predictor. The Bayes factor suggests there is strong evidence that
duration of the Release to Release interval is not affected by C2
voicing.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

Seventeen participants were recorded while reading CV́CV words embedded
in a frame sentence. The stressed vowel was either /a, o, u/, and C2 was
one of /t, d, k, g/. Of the seventeen participants, 11 are native
speakers of Italian and 6 of Polish. The durations of the vowel, stop
closure, word, and Release to Release interval were measured from the
acoustic signal. The analyses of the durational data suggest that:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Stressed vowels in C\textsubscript{1}V́\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V words in Italian and Polish are 19 ms longer (SE = 4.4) when C2 is voiced.
  \item C2 closure is 16.5 ms shorter (SE = 3) if the stop is voiced.
  \item V1 duration negatively correlates with closure duration, such that shorter closures correspond to longer vowels.
  \item Both word duration and Release to Release duration are not affected by the underlying voicing specification of C2.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\label{s:discussion}

An exploratory study of articulatory and acoustic aspects of the effect
of consonant voicing on vowel duration in Italian and Polish has been
carried out to look for a possible source of such effect in production.
Only the results from the acoustic part of the study have been presented
in the previous section, since they bear on the arguments that follow.
The following sections discuss, in turn, the results regarding the
effect of voicing on vowel duration in Italian and Polish and how the
finding that the duration of the interval between the two consecutive
consonant releases in CV́CV words is compatible with a compensatory
temporal adjustment account of the voicing effect. The section concludes
by discussing the limitations of this study and further work.

\hypertarget{voicing-effect-in-italian-and-polish}{%
\subsection{Voicing effect in Italian and
Polish}\label{voicing-effect-in-italian-and-polish}}

The results of vowel duration and C2 voicing indicate that vowels are
longer when followed by voiced then when followed by voiceless stops
both in Italian and Polish. The estimated effect is around 16 ms when C2
is voiced for Italian. This value is not too far from the estimates of
previous work on this language
\citep{caldognetto1979, farnetani1986, esposito2002}, the range of which
is between 22 and 24 ms (the higher estimates of these studies could be
related to Type M (magnitude) errors due to low statistical power, see
\citealt{kirby2018}). Furthermore, the effect of voicing on the duration
of Italian /u/ is smaller than with /a/ and /o/ (about 3 vs 16 ms
respectively). No effect of voicing on the duration of /u/ has been
reported by \citealt{ferrero1978}. While it is not clear why the
duration of this particular vowel should not be affected by C2 voicing,
the data reported here indicate that the magnitude of the difference in
closure duration when the preceding vowel is /u/ is smaller than with
/a/ and /o/ (about 7 vs.~17 ms respectively). If vowel duration
compensates for closure duration, then a smaller difference in closure
duration will correspond to a small difference in vowel duration, as the
estimates seem to suggest.

The interpretation of the Polish patterns is complicated. Previous
studies found either no effect or a small voicing effect in Polish
(3.5--4.5 ms). In particular, \citet{malisz2008} say that the effect
seems to be very idiosyncratic in their data of 40 speakers. The
estimated effect found in the 6 speakers reported here is 10.54 ms,
while the difference based on the means of the raw vowel durations is
7.5 ms. Recall, however, that the interaction between language and C2
voicing (which gives the estimate of 10.54) is not significant (see the
full model summary in \Cref{tab:vow-table}). It is likely, though, that
the non-significance might be related to low power. Indeed, only 6
Polish speakers have been recorded, against 11 speakers of Italian. The
raw mean difference of 7.5 ms in Polish---although still higher than
what found in previous studies---might be more informative in this case.

More specifically, when one compares the raw mean duration differences
of vowels with the raw mean duration differences of consonant closures,
a pattern can be seen. The mean differences of Italian vowels and
closures (11.5 and 13.33, respectively) are bigger than those of Polish
(7.54 and 10.87), although by a small amount (about 3 ms). It is
plausible that the smaller effect of C2 voicing on preceding vowel
duration in Polish is related to the smaller effect on closure duration,
if we assume a temporal mechanism of compensation between the closure
and the vowel. Of course, this argument rests on very small differences
from a small sample, and will need to be tested with a bigger sample of
Italian and Polish speakers.

\hypertarget{compensatory-temporal-adjustment}{%
\subsection{Compensatory temporal
adjustment}\label{compensatory-temporal-adjustment}}

Vowels followed by voiced stops are long, while vowels followed by
voiceless stops are short. The closure duration of voiced stops is short
compared to that of voiceless stops. There seems to be an inverse
relationship between vowel duration and closure duration, by which a
long vowel entails a short closure (and vice versa), and a short vowel
entails a long closure (and vice versa).

The data and statistical analyses of this exploratory study suggest that
the duration of the interval between the releases of two consecutive
consonants in CV́CV words (the Release to Release interval) is not
affected to the phonological voicing of the second consonant (C2) in
Italian and Polish. In accordance with a compensatory temporal
adjustment account \citep{slis1969, lehiste1970}, the difference in
vowel duration before voiceless vs.~voiced stops can be seen as the
outcome of differences in stop closure duration. More specifically, the
timing of the (acoustic) closure onset of C2 within the invariant
Release to Release interval determines the duration of the preceding
vowel. An earlier closure onset relative to the onset of the preceding
vowel (like in the case of voiceless stops) causes the vowel to be
shorter. On the other hand, a later closure onset (like with voiced
stops) produces a longer vowel. \Cref{f:compensatory} illustrates this
mechanism.

\begin{figure}

The black bars below the time axis represent voicing (vocal fold vibration). Various landmarks and intervals are indicated in the schematic.}
  \label{f:compensatory}
\end{figure}

The invariance of the Release to Release interval allows us to refine
the logistics of the compensatory account by narrowing the scope of the
temporal adjustment action. A limitation of this account, as proposed by
\citet{slis1969} and \citet{lehiste1970}, is the lack of a precise
identification of the word-internal mechanics of compensation. As
already discussed in \Cref{s:intro}, it is not clear, for example, why
the adjustment should target the preceding stressed vowel, rather then
the following unstressed vowel or any other segment in the word. Since
the Release to Release interval includes just the vowel (broadly defined
as a vocoid gesture) and the consonant closure, it follows that
differences in closure duration must be reflected in differences in the
duration of the preceding vowel. It is worth noting, though, that other
accounts---which could be compatible with other aspects of production
and perception---aren't ultimately ruled out (for example, perceptual
factor might play a role in the enhancement of the effect, see
\citealt{kingston1994}, \citealt{port1982}, and \citealt{luce1985}).

On the one hand, the voicing effect can be re-interpreted as a
by-product of gestural timing, rather then a consequence of intrinsic
features of voicing \emph{per SE}, with a constant Release to Release
interval as the explanans.

\citet{de-jong1991} reports that the closing gesture of voiceless stops
(following stressed vowels) is faster than that of voiced stops, and
that also it is timed earlier with respect to the opening gesture of the
stressed vowel. According to \citet{de-jong1991}, the differences in
vowel duration are driven by the timing of the consonantal closing
gesture relative to the vocalic opening gesture (also see
\citealt{hertrich1997}). Moreover, the data in \citet{de-jong1991} show
that the final portion of the opening gesture is prolonged before voiced
stops.

This pattern fits the one reported in an electromyographic study by
\citet{raphael1975}. The electromyographic signal corresponding to the
vocalic gesture reaches its plateau at the same time relative to the
preceding consonant in the voiceless and voiced context, but the plateau
is held for longer in the case of vowels followed by voiced stops. This
indicates that muscular activation in the vocalic gesture before voiced
stops is held for longer. \citet{raphael1975} further notes that the
durational difference in muscular activation corresponds to the
difference in the acoustic duration of vowels before voiceless
vs.~voiced stops (see also \citealt{warren2005}).

The results of the studies just discussed, together with the results
from this study, bring support to a view in which two aspects of
gestural organisation contribute to the difference in vowel duration
observed before consonants varying in their voicing specification. These
aspects are: (1) the \emph{right-edge alignment} of coda consonants
following a stressed vowel relative to the latter, and (2) the
\emph{differential timing of the closing gesture onset} for voiceless
vs.~voiced stops. The interplay of these two aspects can be synthesised
into a compensatory temporal adjustment account, which requires a
temporally constant interval, produced by (1), and a temporal
reorganisation, brought about by (2).

\hypertarget{limitations-and-future-work}{%
\subsection{Limitations and future
work}\label{limitations-and-future-work}}

The generalisations put forward in this paper strictly apply to
disyllabic words with a stressed vowel in the first syllable. It is
possible that the organisation pattern found in this context does not
occur in sequences including an unstressed vowel. For example, it is
known that the difference in closure duration between voiceless and
voiced stops is not stable when the stops precede a stressed vowel,
although vowels preceding pre-stress stops have slightly different
durations \citep{davis1989}. According to the gestural interpretation
given here, the absence of differences in closure duration should
correspond to no difference in vowel duration. Moreover, the magnitude
of the effect is modulated by prosodic characteristics, like the number
of syllables in the word, presence/absence of focus, and position within
the sentence \citep{sharf1962, klatt1973, laeufer1992, de-jong2004}.
Data from different contexts and different languages is thus needed to
assess the generality of the claims put forward in this paper.

The constraints on experimental material enforced by the use of
ultrasound tongue imaging have been previously mentioned in
\Cref{s:materials}. Given these constraints, temporal information from
other vowels (like front vowels) and places of articulation is a
desideratum. \Cref{s:gestural} discusses the interpretation of the
Release to Release invariance in CV́CV words as a consequence of the
timing of C2 rather than of a holistic CV́C motor plan in which the
Release to Release interval is held constant. Although beyond the scope
of this paper, disambiguating between these two interpretations on
articulatory grounds is fundamental for a general understanding of a
theory of gestural organisation (a promising venue of research might be
the activation-spin model by \citealt{tilsen2013}).

The compensatory temporal adjustment account presented here extends to
other durational effects discussed in the literature. In particular, the
account bears predictions on the direction of the durational difference
led by phonation types different from voicing, like aspiration and
ejection. For example, the mix of results with regard to the effect of
aspiration \citep{durvasula2012} suggests that the conditions for a
temporal adjustment might differ across the contexts and languages
studied. In light of the results in \citet{begus2017}, future studies
will have to investigate the durational invariance of speech intervals
in relation to a variety of phonation contrasts.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The results of an exploratory study on the effect of voicing on vowel
duration are congruent with a compensatory temporal adjustment account
of such effect. Acoustic data from seventeen speakers of Italian and
Polish show that the temporal distance between two consecutive stop
releases is not affected by the voicing of the second stop in CV́CV
words. The temporal invariance of the Release to Release interval,
together with a difference in stop closure duration of voiceless and
voiced stops, causes vowels to be shorter when followed by voiceless
stops (which have a long closure) and longer when followed by voiced
stops (the closure of which is short). I proposed that the Release to
Release invariance is a consequence of the gestural organisation of the
CV́C sequence, in which the lag between the right-edge of the second
consonant and the preceding stressed vowel is fixed.
