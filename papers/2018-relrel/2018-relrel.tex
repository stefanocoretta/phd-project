\begin{abstract}
  Over a century of phonetic research has established the cross-linguistic existence of the so called `voicing effect', by which vowels tend to be shorter when followed by voiceless stops and longer when the following stop is voiced.
  However, no agreement is found among scholars regarding the source of this effect, and several causal accounts have been advanced.
  A notable one is the compensatory temporal adjustment account, according to which the duration of the vowel is inversely correlated with the stop closure duration (voiceless stops having longer closure durations than voiced stops).
  The compensatory account has been criticised due to lack of empirical support and its vagueness regarding the temporal interval within which compensation is implemented.
  The results from an exploratory study of Italian and Polish suggest that the duration of the interval between two consecutive stop releases in CVCV words in these languages is not affected by the voicing of the second stop.
  The durational difference of the first vowel and the stop closure would then follow from differences in timing of the VC boundary within this interval.
  While other aspects, like production mechanisms related to laryngeal features effects and perceptual biases cannot be ruled out, the data discussed here are compatible with a production account based on compensatory mechanisms.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\label{s:intro}

Almost a hundred years of research have consistently shown that
consonantal voicing has an effect on preceding vowel duration: vowels
followed by voiced obstruents are longer than when followed by voiceless
ones (\citealt{meyer1904}; \citealt{heffner1937}; \citealt{belasco1953};
\citealt{house1953}; \citealt{peterson1960}; \citealt{halle1967};
\citealt{chen1970}; \citealt{klatt1973}; \citealt{lisker1974};
\citealt{fowler1992}; \citealt{laeufer1992}; \citealt{hussein1994};
\citealt{lampp2004}; \citealt{warren2005}; \citealt{durvasula2012}).
This so called ``voicing effect'' has been found in a considerable
variety of
languages.\footnote{One of the first attestations of the term `voicing effect' can be attributed to \citet{mitleb1982}. Another term used to refer to the same phenomenon is `pre-fortis clipping', probably introduced by \citet{wells1990}.}
These include (but are not limited to) English, German, French, Spanish,
Hindi, Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Korean (see \citealt{maddieson1976}
for a more comprehensive, but still not exhaustive
list).\footnote{A typological note. Most languages reported having a voicing effect come from the Indo-European family. Others are from a pool of widely studied languages. It is thus of vital importance that future studies look at other language families and underdocumented/underdescribed languages.}
Despite of the plethora of evidence in support of the \emph{existence}
of the voicing effect, agreement hasn't been reached regarding its
\emph{source}.

Several proposals have been put forward in relation to the possible
source of the voicing effect (see \citealt{soskuthy2013} and
\citealt{begus2017} for an overview). Some of the proposed mechanisms
for the emergence of the voicing effect refer to properties of speech
production. A notable production account, which will be the focus of
this study, is based on compensatory temporal adjustments
\citep{lindblom1967, slis1969a, slis1969, lehiste1970a, lehiste1970}.
According to this account, the voicing effect follows from the
reorganisation of gestures within a unit of speech the duration of which
is not affected by stop voicing. The duration of such a unit is held
constant across voicing contexts, while the duration of voiceless and
voiced obstruents differs. The closure of voiceless stops is longer than
that of voiced stops
\citep{lisker1957, van-summers1987, davis1989, de-jong1991}. As a
consequence, vowels followed by voiceless stops (which have a long
closure) are shorter than vowels followed by voiced stops (which have a
short closure). Advocates of a compensatory mechanism propose two
prosodic units as the scope of the temporal adjustment: the syllable
(and, equivalently, the VC sequence or vowel-to-vowel interval,
\citealt{lindblom1967, farnetani1986}), and the word
\citep{slis1969a, slis1969, lehiste1970a, lehiste1970}. However, the
compensatory temporal adjustment account has been criticised in
subsequent work.

Empirical evidence and logic challenge the proposal that the syllable or
the word have a constant duration and hence drive compensation. First,
Lindblom's \citeyear{lindblom1967} argument that the duration of the
syllable is constant is not supported by the findings in
\citet{chen1970} and \citet{jacewicz2009}. \citet{chen1970} rejects a
syllable-based compensatory mechanism in the light of the fact that the
duration of the syllable is affected by consonant voicing.
\citet{jacewicz2009} further show that the duration of monosyllabic
words in American English changes depending on the voicing of the coda
consonant. Second, although the results in \citet{slis1969} suggest that
the duration of disyllabic words in Dutch is constant whether the second
stop is voiceless or voiced, it does not follow from this fact that
compensation should necessarily target the vowel preceding the stop.
Indeed, it is logically possible that the following unstressed vowel
could be the target of the compensation, therefore differences in
preceding vowel duration still call for an explanation.

The compensatory temporal adjustment account has been further challenged
on the basis of the so called ``aspiration effect''
\citep{maddieson1976}, by which vowels are longer when followed by
aspirated stops than when followed by unaspirated stops. In Hindi,
vowels before voiceless unaspirated stops are short, vowels followed by
voiced aspirated stops are long, and vowels followed by voiced
unaspirated and voiceless aspirated stops are in between and have
similar durations. \citet{maddieson1976} find no compensatory pattern
between vowel and consonant duration. The consonant /t/, which has the
shortest duration, is preceded by the shortest vowel, and vowels before
/d/ and /tʰ/ have the same duration although the durations of the two
consonants are different. \citet{maddieson1976} argue that a
compensatory explanation for differences in vowel duration cannot be
maintained.

However, a re-evaluation of the way consonant duration is measured in
\citet{maddieson1976} might actually turn their findings in favour of a
compensatory account. Due to difficulties in detecting the release of
the consonant of interest, consonant duration in \citet{maddieson1976}
is measured from the closure of the relevant consonant to the release of
the following, (e.g., in \emph{ab sāth kaho}, the duration of /tʰ/ in
\emph{sāth} is calculated as the interval between the closure of /tʰ/
and the release of /k/). This measure includes the burst and aspiration
(if present) of the consonant following the target vowel.
\citet{slis1969a}, however, state that the inverse relation between
vowel duration and the following consonant applies to \textit{closure}
duration, and not to the entire \textit{consonant}
duration.\footnote{In this paper, I use the term \textit{relation} to mean a categorical pattern of entailment (like in `a long vowel entails a short closure'), while the term \textit{correlation} is reserved to a statistical correlation of two continuous variables.}
If an inverse relation exists between vowel and closure duration, the
inclusion of burst and/or aspiration clearly alters this relationship.

Indeed, the study on Hindi voicing and aspiration effects conducted by
\citet{durvasula2012} indicates that closure duration, measured from
closure onset to closure offset, decreases according to the hierarchy
voiceless unaspirated \textgreater{} voiced unaspirated \textgreater{}
voiceless aspirated \textgreater{} voiced aspirated, which closely
resembles the order of increasing vowel duration in
\citet{maddieson1976}. Nonetheless, \citet{durvasula2012} do not find a
negative correlation between vowel duration and consonant closure
duration, but rather a (small) \emph{positive effect}. Vowel duration
increases with closure duration when voicing and aspiration are taken
into account. However, as noted in \citet{begus2017}, it is likely that
this result is a consequence of not controlling for speech rate. A small
negative effect of closure duration can turn positive if the effect of
speech rate (which is positive) is greater, given the cumulative nature
of these effects.

\citet{de-jong1991} finds partial support for a compensatory mechanism
between vowel and closure duration in an electro-magneto-articulometric
study of two American English speakers. The duration of vowels in
nuclear accented, pre-, and post-nuclear accented position is weakly
negatively correlated with closure duration (the slope coefficients
range between -0.12 and -0.35, meaning that the amount of durational
compensation is between 10\% and 35\%). While the magnitude of the
correlation is too weak to univocally support compensation, the
direction of the correlation is correct (i.e.~a negative correlation).

Further evidence for a compensatory account and a negative correlation
between vowel and closure duration comes from the effect of a third type
of consonants, namely ejectives. \citet{begus2017} finds that in
Georgian (which contrasts aspirated, voiced, and ejective consonants)
vowels are short when followed by voiceless aspirated stops, longer
before ejective stops, and longest when followed by voiced stops.
Crucially, stop closure duration follows the reversed pattern: closure
is short in voiced stops, longer in ejectives, and longest in voiceless
aspirated stops. Moreover, vowel duration is inversely correlated with
closure across the three phonation types. \citet{begus2017} mentions the
possibility that the negative correlation is an artefact of the vowel
and closure intervals sharing a boundary. This annotation bias could
generate negative correlations (by which the vowel would shorten and the
closure would lengthen by the same amount when, for example, the
boundary is placed to the left of the ``actual'' boundary). However,
Beguš shows with a cross-annotator analysis that this was not the case.
\citet{begus2017} argues that these findings support temporal
compensation (although not univocally, see
\citealt[Section V]{begus2017}, and \Cref{s:comp} of this paper).

To summarise, a mechanism of compensatory temporal adjustment has been
proposed as the pathway to the emergence of the voicing effect.
According to such an account, the difference in vowel duration before
consonants varying in voicing (and possibly other phonation types) is
the outcome of a compensation between vowel and closure duration. After
reviewing the critiques advanced by \citet{chen1970} and
\citet{maddieson1976}, and in face of the results in \citet{slis1969},
\citet{de-jong1991} and \citet{begus2017}, a temporal compensation
mechanism gains credibility. However, issues about the actual
implementation of the compensation mechanism still remain. While
compensatory temporal adjustments are plausible in light of the reviewed
literature, we are still left with the necessity of identifying a speech
interval the duration of which is not affected by the voicing of the
post-vocalic consonant, and within which compensation can be logically
implemented.

\subsection{The present study}\label{the-present-study}}

This paper reports on selected results from a broader exploratory study
that investigates the relationship between vowel duration and consonant
voicing from both an acoustic and articulatory perspective. Synchronised
recordings of audio, ultrasound tongue imaging, and electroglottography
were carried out to enable a data-driven approach to the analysis of
features related to the voicing effect in the context of disyllabic
(CV́CV) words in Italian and
Polish.\footnote{As per \citet{cysouw2013}, the glossonyms \textit{Italian} and \textit{Polish} as used here to refer, respectively, to the languoids Italian [\textsc{Glottocode}: \texttt{ital1282}] and Polish [\textsc{Glottocode}: \texttt{poli1260}].}
This study was not designed to test the compensatory account, but rather
to collect synchronised articulatory and acoustic data on the voicing
effect. Moreover, the design of the study has been constrained by the
use of ultrasound articulatory techniques (see \Cref{s:method}). Since
the tongue imaging and electroglottographic data don't bear on the main
argument put forward here, only the results from acoustics will be
discussed.

Italian and Polish reportedly differ in the magnitude (or presence) of
the effect of stop voicing on vowel duration. On the other hand, the
typical realisation of phonological voiced stops in these languages are
similar (but see \citealt{huszthy2016} and \citealt{schwartz2018} for a
phonological and phonetic discussion on laryngeal aspects of Italian and
Polish
respectively).\footnote{Polish neutralises the voicing contrast word-finally, although the contrast is maintained word-medially \citep{gussmann2007}.}
\citet{cyran2011} argues for a distinction between voicing and
aspirating varieties of Polish, based on phonological arguments.
\citet{waniek2011}, on the other hand, cautiously argues that a possible
change in progress in Polish is affecting the VOT values of voiceless
stops in pre-stressed position.

The non-clear status of Polish laryngeal phonology/phonetics could be
seen as a hindrance affecting the comparison with Italian. However,
based on data from Italian, \citet{kirby2016a} propose that the
distinction between voicing and aspirating languages itself
\citep{beckman2013} cannot be straightforwardly mapped onto phonetics,
and they remind us that ``the production of laryngeal contrasts of all
kinds are considerably more complex'' than generally described in the
phonological literature \citep[2409]{kirby2016a}. Since this study
focusses on the effect of post-stressed stops on preceding vowel
durations, we believe that the comparison between Italian and Polish is
still feasible, even in the case Polish voiceless pre-stressed stops are
articulated with longer VOT values. Given that Italian and Polish share
some features of the segmental and prosodic make-up of their
phonological systems, the design of the experimental material and
comparison of the results were facilitated. For these reasons, these
languages offer an opportunity to investigate differences that could
reveal mechanisms underlying the voicing effect, at least on a general
level.

Italian has been unanimously reported as a voicing-effect language
\citep{caldognetto1979, farnetani1986, esposito2002}. The mean
difference in vowel duration when followed by voiceless vs.~voiced
consonants ranges between 22 and 24 ms in these studies, with longer
vowels followed by voiced consonants. The mean differences are based on
3 speakers in \citet{farnetani1986} and 7 speakers in
\citet{esposito2002}. \citet{caldognetto1979} don't report estimates of
vowel duration, just the direction of the effect, but the study is based
on 10 speakers.

The results regarding the presence and magnitude of the effect in Polish
are instead mixed. \citet{slowiaczek1985} find that vowels followed by
word-final underlyingly voiced stops are 10--15 ms longer in 5 Polish
speakers, although \citet{jassem1989} did not replicate their results.
Similarly, \citet{keating1984} reports a difference of 2 ms in the
duration of stressed vowels in disyllabic words from 24 speakers, which
the author argues to be non-significant. On the other hand,
\citet{nowak2006} finds that vowels followed by voiced stops are 4.5 ms
longer in the 4 speakers recorded. \citet{malisz2008} argue based on
data from 40 speakers that the magnitude of the voicing effect in Polish
is highly idiosyncratic, and claim that their results are inconclusive
on this matter. While they do not report estimates from the 40 speakers,
a table with mean vowel durations from 4 suggests a mean difference
before voiceless vs.~voiced stops of 3.5 ms. Finally,
\citet{strycharczuk2012a} reports a non-significant effect in 6 speakers
in pre-sonorant word-final position.

The variety of results concerning the voicing effect in Polish could be
related to differences in methodology. However, no clear pattern between
studies which find a voicing effect and those which don't can be
identified. For example, the studies reviewed here looked at either
word-final or word-medial stops, controlled or read speech, speakers
with a low or advanced proficiency in English. However, in all the
individual cases both a positive and a negative result are reported
depending on the study. What might be more relevant, though, is that the
estimates of the difference in vowel duration are generally very low,
between 3.5 and 15 ms. Given the small magnitude of the difference, it
is likely that the failure to obtain significant \emph{p}-values in some
studies are due to low statistical power, rather than because of absence
of the effect (as also hinted in \citealt{begus2017}, see arguments in
\citealt{roettger2019} and \citealt{nicenboim2018a}).

The acoustic data from the study discussed here suggests that (1) a
voicing effect can be detected both in Italian and Polish, and that (2)
the duration of the interval between two consecutive stop releases (the
release to release interval) is not affected by the voicing of the
second consonant in both languages. This finding is compatible with a
compensatory temporal adjustment account by which the timing of the
closure onset of the stop following the vowel within said interval
determines the respective durations of vowel and closure.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

Participants were sought in Manchester (UK), and in Verbania (Italy).
Seventeen subjects in total participated in this study. Eleven subjects
are native speakers of Italian (5 female, 6 male), while six are native
speakers of Polish (3 female, 3 male). The Italian speakers are from the
North and Centre of Italy (8 speakers from Northern Italy, 3 from
Central Italy). The Polish group has 2 speakers from Western Poland, 3
speakers from Central Poland, and 1 speaker from Eastern Poland. For
more information on the sociolinguistic details of the speakers, see
Supplementary file 1. Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from
the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76). The participants signed
a written consent and received a monetary compensation of £10.

\hypertarget{equipment}{%
\subsection{Equipment}\label{equipment}}

The acquisition of the audio signal was achieved with the software
Articulate Assistant Advanced™ (AAA, v2.17.2, \citealt{articulate2011})
running on a Hewlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows
7. Audio recordings were sampled at 22050 Hz (16-bit) and saved in a
proprietary format (\texttt{.aa0}). A FocusRight Scarlett Solo
pre-amplifier and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used for audio
recording. The microphone was placed at the level of the participant's
mouth on one side, at a distance of about 10 cm. The microphone was
clipped onto a metal headset worn by the participant, which was part of
the ultrasonic equipment.

\hypertarget{materials}{%
\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}}

\label{s:materials}

The target stimuli were disyllabic words with
C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2}
structure, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o,
u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} =
V\textsubscript{1} (e.g.~/pata/, /pada/, /poto/,
etc.).\footnote{Italian has both a mid-low [ɔ] and a mid-high [o] back vowel in its vowel inventory. These vowels are traditionally described as two distinct phonemes \citep{kramer2009}, although both their phonemic status and their phonetic substance are subject to a high degree of geographical and idiosyncratic variability \citep{renwick2016}. As a rule of thumb, stressed open syllables in Italian (like the ones used in this study) have [ɔː] (vowels in penultimate stressed open syllables are long) rather than [oː] \citep{renwick2016}. On the other hand, Polish has only a mid-low back vowel phoneme /ɔ/ \citep{gussmann2007}. For the sake of typographical simplicity, the symbol /o/ will be used here for both languages.}
Most are nonce words, although inevitably some combinations produce real
words both in Italian (4 words) and Polish (2 words, see Supplementary
file 1). The lexical stress of the target words was placed by speakers
of both Italian and Polish on V\textsubscript{1}, as intended.

The make-up of the target words was constrained by the design of the
experiment, which included ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI). Front vowels
are difficult to be imaged with UTI, since their articulation involves
tongue surface positions which are particularly far from the ultrasonic
probe, hence reducing the visibility of the tongue contour. For this
reason, only central and back vowels were included. Since one of the
variables of interest in the study was the closing gesture of
C\textsubscript{2}, only lingual consonants were used. A labial stop was
chosen as the first consonant to reduce possible coarticulation with the
following vowel (although see \citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007}). The number
of target words was kept low to reduce the time required for completing
the task, since the ultrasonic equipment can get very uncomfortable for
the speaker when worn for more than 15/20 minutes.

The target words were embedded in a frame sentence. Controlling for
meaning, segmental and prosodic make-up between languages proved to be
difficult. The frames are \emph{Dico X lentamente} `I say X slowly' in
Italian \citep[following][]{hajek2008}, and \emph{Mówię X teraz} `I say
X now' in Polish. These sentences were chosen in order to maintain a
similar intonation contour across languages.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

\label{s:procedure}

The participant was asked to read the sentences with the target words
which were presented on the computer screen. The order of the sentences
was randomised for each participant. Participants read the list of
randomised sentence stimuli 6 times. Due to software constraints, the
order of the list was kept the same across the six repetitions within
each participant. The reading task lasted between 15 and 20 minutes,
with optional short breaks between one repetition and the other. The
total session time was around 45 minutes. Before the start of the
experiment, the participants were spoken to in their mother tongue to
try and reduce exposition to English prior to being recorded.
Instructions were also given in their respective mother tongues. Each
speaker read a total of 12 sentences for 6 times (with the exceptions of
IT02, who repeated the 12 sentences 5 times), which yields a grand total
of 1212 tokens (792 from Italian, 420 from Polish).

The experiment was carried out in two locations: in the sound attenuated
booth of the Phonetics Laboratory at the University of Manchester, and
in a quiet room in a field location in Italy (Verbania, Northern Italy).
In both locations the equipment and procedures were the same. Data
collection started in December 2016 and ended in March 2018.

The audio recordings were exported from AAA in the \texttt{.wav} format
for further processing. The sample and bit rate were kept as upon
recording (22050 Hz, 16-bit). A forced aligned transcription was
accomplished through the SPeech Phonetisation Alignment and
Syllabification software (SPPAS, \citealt{bigi2015}). The outcome of the
automatic annotation was manually corrected for the relevant boundaries,
according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures} based on
\citet{machac2009}. Segmentation boundaries not used in the analyses
have not been checked to speed up processing. The releases of C1 and C2
were detected automatically by means of a Praat scripting implementation
of the algorithm described in \citet{ananthapadmanabha2014}, and
subsequently corrected if necessary. The identification of the stop
release was not possible in 99 tokens (8\%) of C1 and 265 tokens (22\%)
of C2 out of 1212. This was due either to the absence of a clear burst
in the waveform and spectrogram, or the realisation of voiced stops as
voiced fricatives. Most of the fricativised tokens come from three
speakers of Central Italian, IT12, IT13, and IT14, a variety of Italian
known to show processes of lenition \citep{hualde2011}.

Moreover IT12 and IT14 produced several tokens of voiceless stops with
voicing during closure (in some cases the closure was completely
voiced). These tokens have been used in the analyses, because (1) the
actual presence or absence of voicing during closure does not bear on
the compensatory account discussed here (which concerns supraglottal
gestures) and laryngeal gestures can be implemented almost entirely
independently from oral gestures, and (2) the voicing effect has been
shown to exist even in whispered speech, where vocal fold vibration is
entirely absent
\citep{sharf1964}.\footnote{A reviewer makes interesting phonological remarks. The presence of lenition and voicing of voiceless stops in some varieties of Italian and its absence in Polish could be related to differences in laryngeal phonology and prosodic structure between these languages, namely the absence of a feature [voice] in Italian and the absence of true trochees in Polish. This hypothesis is compatible with work by \citet{schwartz2018} and \citet{schwartz2016}, to which the reader is referred.}

The durations in milliseconds of the following intervals were extracted
with a series of custom Praat scripts from the annotated acoustic
landmarks: word duration, vowel duration (V1 onset to V1 offset),
consonant closure duration (V1 offset to C2 release), and release to
release duration (C1 release to C2 release). Sentence duration was
measured in seconds. \Cref{f:segmentation} shows an example of the
segmentation of /pata/ (a) and /pada/ (b) from an Italian speaker.
Syllable rate (syllables per second) was used as a proxy to speech rate
\citep{plug2018a}, and was calculated as the number of syllables divided
by the duration of the sentence in seconds (8 syllables in Italian, 6 in
Polish). All further data processing and visualisation was done in R
v3.5.2 \citep{wickham2017, r-core-team2018}.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

Given the data-driven nature of the study, all statistical analyses
reported here are to be considered exploratory (hypothesis-generating)
rather than confirmatory (hypothesis-driven,
\citealt{kerr1998, gelman2013, roettger2018}). The durational
measurements were analysed with linear mixed-effects models using
\texttt{lme4} v1.1-19 in R \citep{bates2015}, and model estimates were
extracted with the \texttt{effects} package v4.1-0 \citep{fox2003}. All
factors were coded with treatment contrasts and the following reference
levels: voiceless (vs.~voiced), /a/ (vs.~/o/, /u/), coronal (vs.~velar),
Italian (vs.~Polish). Speech rate has been centred when included in the
models to make the intercept estimates more interpretable. The models
were fitted by Restricted Maximum Likelihood estimation (REML). The
estimates in the results section refer to these reference levels unless
interactions are discussed. \emph{P}-values for the individual terms
were obtained with \texttt{lmerTest} v3.0-1, which uses the
Satterthwaite's approximation to degrees of freedom
\citep{kuznetsova2017, luke2017}. A result is considered significant if
the \emph{p}-value is below the alpha level (\(\alpha = 0.05\)). The
choice of not using likelihood ratio tests for statistical inference is
based on \citet{luke2017} who argues that this approach can lead to
inflated Type I error rates. In any case, \citet[1501]{luke2017} also
warns that `results {[}from mixed-effects models{]} should be
interpreted with caution, regardless of the method adopted for obtaining
\textit{p}-values'. Inspection of residual plots and QQ plots of the
models described below indicated absence of patterns in the residuals.

Bayes factors were used to test whether word and release to release
duration are not affected by C2 voicing (i.e., the effect of C2 voicing
on duration is
\texttt{0}).\footnote{The choice of Bayes factors over other information criteria, like AIC, is a practical one. First, Bayes factors can be used to identify the realative strength of the evidence for each hypothesis. The higher the Bayes factor of H\textsubscript{01}, the stronger the evidence for H\textsubscript{0} according to the data. Second, a Bayes factor near 1 indicates that the data is compatible with both hypotheses (even when AIC indicates a preference of one over the other), in which case it is not possible to chose among them. Note that the AICs of the word duration and release to release duration models reported below are lower when C2 voicing is not included as a predictor than when it is included, although the difference in AIC between the null and full models is very small (below 2).}
For each set of null/alternative hypotheses, a full model (with the
predictor of interest) and a null model (excluding it) were fitted
separately using the Maximum Likelihood estimation (ML,
\citealt[34]{bates2015}). The Bayes Information Criterion (BIC)
approximation was then used to obtain Bayes factors
\citep{raftery1995, raftery1999, wagenmakers2007, jarosz2014}. The
approximation is calculated according to the equation in \ref{eq:bayes}
\citep[796]{wagenmakers2007}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayes}
BF_{01} \approx exp(\Delta{}BIC_{10}/2)
\end{equation}

where \(\Delta{}BIC_{10} = BIC_1 - BIC_0\), \(BIC_1\) is the BIC of the
full model, and \(BIC_0\) is the BIC of the null model. Values of
\(BF_{01} > 1\) indicate a preference of H\textsubscript{0} over
H\textsubscript{1}. The interpretation of the Bayes factors follows the
recommendations in \citet[p.~139]{raftery1995}: 1--3 = weak evidence,
3--20 = positive evidence, 20--150 = strong evidence, \textgreater{} 150
= very strong evidence.

The extracted measurements were filtered before statistical analysis.
Measures of vowel duration, closure duration, word duration, and release
to release duration that are 3 standard deviations lower or higher than
the respective means were excluded from the final dataset (this
procedure generally corresponds to a loss of around 2.5\% of the data).
One sentence (sentence 48 of IT07, \emph{Dico pada lentamente}) included
a speech error and has been excluded. After excluding missing
measurements, these operations yield a total of 920 tokens of vowel and
closure durations, 1176 tokens of word duration, and 848 tokens of
release to release duration.

\label{s:vduration}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\Cref{f:Figure2} shows boxplots and raw data of vowel duration for the
three vowels /a, o, u/ when followed by voiceless or voiced stops in
Italian and Polish. Vowels tend to be longer when followed by a voiced
stop in both languages. The effect appears to be greater in Italian than
in Polish, especially for the vowels /a/ and /o/. There is no evident
effect of C2 voicing in /u/ in Italian, but the effect is discernible in
Polish /u/. In Italian, vowels have a mean duration of 106.16 ms (SD =
27.08) before voiceless stops, and a mean duration of 117.66 ms (SD =
34.63) before voiced stops. Polish vowels are on average 75.57 ms long
(SD = 16.16) when followed by a voiceless stop, and 83.11 ms long (SD =
19.37) if a voiced stop follows. The difference in vowel duration based
on the raw means is 11.5 ms in Italian and 7.54 ms in Polish.

A linear mixed-effects model with vowel duration as the outcome variable
was fitted with the following predictors: fixed effects for C2 voicing
(voiceless, voiced), C2 place of articulation (coronal, velar), vowel
(a, o, u), language (Italian, Polish), and speech rate (as syllables per
second, centred); by-speaker and by-word random intercepts with
by-speaker random slopes for C2 voicing. All possible interactions
between C2 voicing, vowel, and language were included. The following
terms are significant according to \emph{t}-tests with Satterthwaite's
approximation to degrees of freedom: C2 voicing, C2 place, vowel,
language, and speech rate. Only the interaction between C2 voicing and
vowel is significant. Vowels are 16.28 ms longer (SE = 4.42) when
followed by a voiced stop (C2 voicing), and 8 ms shorter (SE = 1.63)
when followed by a velar stop. The effect of C2 voicing is smaller with
/u/ (around 3 ms, \(\hat{\beta}\) = -13.1 ms, SE = 5.56). Polish has on
average shorter vowels than Italian (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -24.05 ms, SE =
7.83), and the effect of voicing is estimated to be about 10.55 ms
(although note that the interaction between language and C2 voicing is
not significant). Speech rate has a negative effect on vowel duration,
such that faster rates correlate with shorter vowel durations
(\(\hat{\beta}\) = -16.23 ms, SE = 1.26).

\end{figure}

\Cref{f:Figure3} illustrates stop closure durations with boxplots and
individual raw data points. A pattern opposite to that with vowel
duration can be noticed: closure duration is shorter for voiced than for
voiceless stops. The closure of voiced stops in Italian is 106.16 ms
long (SD = 27.08), while the voiceless stops have a mean closure
duration of 117.66 ms (SD = 34.63). In Polish, the closure duration is
75.57 ms (SD = 16.16) in voiced stops and 83.11 ms (SD = 19.37) in
voiceless stops. The difference in closure duration based on the raw
means is 13.33 ms in Italian and 10.87 ms in Polish. The same model
specification as with vowel duration has been fitted with consonant
closure duration as the outcome variable. C2 voicing, C2 place, and
speech rate are significant. Stop closure is 17.5 ms shorter (SE = 4) if
the stop is voiced and 3.5 ms longer (SE = 1.5) if velar. Finally,
faster speech rates correlate with shorter closure durations
(\(\hat{\beta}\) = -8.5 ms, SE = 1 ms).

\end{figure}

A model addressing the relationship between vowel and stop closure
duration was fitted with the following terms and interactions: vowel
duration as the outcome variable; as fixed effects, closure duration,
vowel, speech rate (centred); all logical interactions between closure
duration, vowel, and speech rate; by-speaker and by-word random
intercepts. Closure duration has a significant effect on vowel duration
(\(\hat{\beta}\) = -0.19 ms, SE = 0.06 ms). The effect with /u/ is
greater than with /a/ and /o/ (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -0.23 ms, SE = 0.08
ms). In general, closure duration is inversely proportional to vowel
duration. However, such a correlation is quite weak, as shown by the
small estimates. A 1 ms increase in closure duration corresponds to a
0.2--0.45 ms decrease in vowel duration. These estimates can be
interpreted in terms of percentages of compensation, which range between
20 and 45\%. Note, moreover, that the negative correlation found here
could be a consequence of annotation bias, since the vowel and closure
share a boundary. Faster speech rates elicit a bigger effect than lower
speech rates, as indicated by the significant interaction between
closure duration and speech rate (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -0.2 ms, SE = 0.06
ms). The effect of the interaction is reduced when the vowel is /u/
(\(\hat{\beta}\) = 0.17 ms, SE = 0.08 ms). \Cref{f:Figure4} shows for
each vowel /a, o, u/ the individual data points and the regression lines
with 95\% confidence intervals extracted from the mixed-effects model.

\hypertarget{word-duration}{%
\subsection{Word duration}\label{word-duration}}

Words with a voiceless C2 are on average 393.72 ms long (SD = 79.05) in
Italian and 387.72 ms long (SD = 73.45) in Polish. Words with a voiced
stop have a mean duration of 357.07 ms (SD = 39.14) in Italian and
361.87 ms (SD = 38.51) in Polish. The following full and null models
were fitted to test the effect of C2 voicing on word duration. The full
model is made up of the following fixed effects: C2 voicing, C2 place,
vowel, language, and speech rate. The model also includes by-speaker and
by-word random intercepts, and a by-speaker random slope for C2 voicing.
The null model is the same as the full model with the exclusion of the
fixed effect of C2 voicing. The Bayes factor of the null against the
full model is 19. Thus, the null model (in which there is no effect of
C2 voicing, \(\beta\) = 0) is 19 times more likely under the observed
data than the full model. This indicates that there is positive evidence
for a null effect of C2 voicing on word duration.

\end{figure}

In \Cref{f:Figure5}, boxplots and raw data points show the duration of
the release to release interval in words with a voiceless vs.~a voiced
C2 stop, in Italian and Polish. It can be seen that the distributions,
medians, and quartiles of the durations in the voiceless and voiced
condition do not differ much in either language. In Italian, the mean
duration of the release to release interval is 209.88 ms (SD = 43.84) if
C2 is voiceless, and 208.6 ms (SD = 41.34) if voiced. In Polish, the
mean durations are respectively 173.13 (SD = 22.44) and 172.67 (SD =
20.47) ms. The specifications of the null and full models for the
release to release duration are the same as for word duration. The Bayes
factor of the null model against the full model is 21, which means that
the null model (without C2 voicing) is 21 times more likely than the
model with C2 voicing as a predictor. The Bayes factor suggests there is
strong evidence that duration of the release to release interval is not
affected by C2 voicing.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\label{s:discussion}

A study of articulatory and acoustic aspects of the effect of consonant
voicing on vowel duration in Italian and Polish has been carried out to
look for a possible source of such an effect in speech production. Only
the results from the acoustic part of the study bear on the main
argument of this paper. The following sections discuss, in turn, the
results regarding the effect of voicing on vowel duration in Italian and
Polish and how the finding that the duration of the interval between the
two consecutive consonant releases in CV́CV words is compatible with a
compensatory temporal adjustment account of the voicing effect. The
section concludes by discussing the limitations and open issues of this
study.

\hypertarget{voicing-effect-in-italian-and-polish}{%
\subsection{Voicing effect in Italian and
Polish}\label{voicing-effect-in-italian-and-polish}}

The results of vowel duration and C2 voicing indicate that vowels are
longer when followed by voiced than when followed by voiceless stops
both in Italian and Polish. The estimated effect is around 16 ms when C2
is voiced for Italian. This value is not too far from the estimates of
previous works on this language
\citep{caldognetto1979, farnetani1986, esposito2002}, the range of which
is between 22 and 24 ms. The higher estimates of these studies compared
to the one here could be related to differences in experimental design,
or Type M (magnitude) errors due to low statistical power (see
\citealt{kirby2018}). The estimate of the effect of voicing on C2
closure duration is around -18 ms. Crucially, the effect of voicing on
vowel and closure duration have very similar magnitudes and opposite
signs. These results suggest a compensatory mechanism between vowel and
closure duration.

Furthermore, the effect of voicing on the duration of Italian /u/ is
smaller than with /a/ and /o/ (about 3 vs.~16 ms respectively), a fact
already observed by \citet{ferrero1978}. While it is not clear why the
duration of this particular vowel should not be affected by C2 voicing,
the data reported here indicate that the magnitude of the difference in
closure duration when the preceding vowel is /u/ is smaller than with
/a/ and /o/ (about 7 vs.~17 ms respectively). If vowel duration
compensates for closure duration, then a smaller difference in closure
duration should correspond to a small difference in vowel duration, as
the estimates seem to suggest.

The interpretation of the Polish results is less straightforward.
Previous studies found either no voicing effect or a small effect in
Polish (3.5--4.5 ms). In particular, \citet{malisz2008} say that the
effect seems to be very idiosyncratic in the 40 speakers of their
analysis. The estimated effect found in the 6 Polish speakers of the
present study is about 10.5 ms, and the difference based on the means of
the raw vowel durations is 7.5 ms. Recall, however, that the interaction
between language and C2 voicing (which gives the estimate of 10.54) is
not significant (see the full model summary in Supplementary file 1). It
is likely, though, that the non-significance might be related to low
power. Indeed, the raw mean difference of 7.5 ms in Polish---although
still higher than what found in previous studies---might be more
informative.

More specifically, when one compares the raw mean duration differences
of vowels with the raw mean duration differences of consonant closures,
a pattern can be seen. The mean differences of Italian vowels and
closures (11.5 and 13.33, respectively) are bigger than those of Polish
(7.54 and 10.87), even if by just a small amount. It is plausible that
the smaller effect of C2 voicing on preceding vowel duration in Polish
is related to the smaller effect on closure duration, if we assume a
temporal mechanism of compensation between the closure and the vowel.
These patterns will need to be confirmed with a more balanced sample of
Italian and Polish speakers.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Figure6-1} \caption{By-speaker random coefficients and error bars for the effect of C2 voicing on vowel duration, extracted from a mixed-effect model (Section 3.1)}\label{f:Figure6}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, while the estimated differences in vowel durations
can be interpreted in reference to Italian and Polish as two independent
linguistic objects, the patterns observed in the individual speakers
does not indicate a systematic relation between magnitude of the effect
and language. \Cref{f:Figure6} shows the random coefficients of the
effect of C2 voicing on vowel duration for the individual speakers,
extracted from the mixed-effects model presented in \Cref{s:vduration}.
Black indicates Italian speakers, while grey is for Polish speakers. As
can be seen, speakers of both languages are scattered along the values
of the voicing effect. These results are in agreement with the
idiosyncrasy of the voicing effect of Polish found in
\citet{malisz2008}. While large-scale studies could reveal clear
language-level patterns, the data discussed here point to a scenario in
which the speaker's individual behaviour is substantial. Future studies
could thus look into the respective role of individual-level and
community-level factors and how these contribute to the magnitude of the
durational differences across speakers and languages.

\hypertarget{compensatory-temporal-adjustment}{%
\subsection{Compensatory temporal
adjustment}\label{compensatory-temporal-adjustment}}

\label{s:comp}

Vowels followed by voiced stops are long, while vowels followed by
voiceless stops are short. The closure duration of voiced stops is short
compared to that of voiceless stops. There seems to be an inverse
relation between vowel duration and closure duration, by which a long
vowel entails a short closure (and vice versa), and a short vowel
entails a long closure (and vice versa).

The data and statistical analyses of this study suggest that the
duration of the interval between the releases of two consecutive
consonants in CV́CV words (the release to release interval) is not
affected by the phonological voicing of the second consonant (C2) in
Italian and Polish. In accordance with a compensatory temporal
adjustment account \citep{slis1969, lehiste1970}, the difference in
vowel duration and closure durations before voiceless vs.~voiced stops
can be seen as the outcome of differences in timing of the vowel
offset/closure onset (more neutrally, the VC boundary). In other words,
the timing of the VC boundary within the temporally stable release to
release interval determines the duration of both the vowel and the stop
closure. An earlier VC boundary relative to the onset of the preceding
vowel results in a shorter vowel and a longer stop closure. On the other
hand, a later VC boundary produces a longer vowel and a shorter closure.
\Cref{f:compensatory} illustrates this compensatory mechanism. Note that
the term ``temporal stability'' (and ``temporally stable'') as used here
means that the underlying statistical distribution of the interval
duration is stable \emph{across contexts of C2 voicing}. No specific
statement is implied about the variance of the duration around the mean,
across or within phonological contexts.

The black bars below the time axis represent voicing (vocal fold vibration). Various landmarks and intervals are indicated in the schematic}
  \label{f:compensatory}
\end{figure}

The invariance of the release to release interval allows us to refine
the logistics of the compensatory account by narrowing the scope of the
temporal adjustment action. A limitation of this account, as proposed by
\citet{slis1969} and \citet{lehiste1970}, is the lack of a precise
identification of the word-internal mechanics of compensation. As
already discussed in \Cref{s:intro}, it is not clear why the adjustment
should target the preceding stressed vowel, rather than the following
unstressed vowel or any other segment in the word. Since the release to
release interval includes just the vocoid gesture between the release of
C1 and the VC boundary, and the consonant closure, it follows that
differences in the timing of the VC boundary must be reflected in
differences in both vowel and closure durations.

Under an account of temporal compensation, the voicing effect can be
interpreted as a by-product of gestural phasing and mechanisms operating
on the timing of the VC boundary. The temporal stability of the release
to release interval across voicing contexts allows us to refine the
compensatory mechanism by providing a temporal anchor. On the other
hand, it is important to note that the release to release interval
should not necessarily have a special status in such a compensatory
account, but rather can be used as a proxy to the understanding of a
full gestural mechanism of compensation. Indeed, the temporal stability
of this interval should be derivable from a theory of gestural phasing,
rather than one that simply states that the interval is stable across
voicing contexts.

The non-exclusivity of the release to release interval is also shown by
the fact that excluding the VOT from it still indicates that C2 voicing
is not affecting the interval duration. The duration of the vowel onset
to release interval (the release to release minus VOT) is stable across
voicing contexts (Bayes factor = 9). However, the duration of release to
release interval has relatively more cohesion than that of the vowel
onset to release interval, as indicated by two measures of relative
dispersion (the coefficient of variation CV and the coefficient of
quartile variation CQV, see
\citealt{bonett2006}).\footnote{The CV of the release to release duration is 0.203, while that of the vowel onset to release duration is 0.232. The CQV is 0.127 for the release to release and 0.136 for the vowel onset to release. Lower values mean less dispersion/more cohesion.}
On the other hand, the duration of the interval between the vowel onset
of V1 to the vowel onset of V2 does change depending on C2 voicing (the
interval it's around 20 ms longer if C2 is voiceless). This fact is
simply a consequence of including the VOT of C2 in the measure.
Voiceless stops have longer VOT values, which increases the duration of
the interval. The difficulty in identifying a clear-cut time point
corresponding to vowel onset could explain the relative higher
dispersion of the vowel onset to release interval duration. For these
reasons, the release to release interval is probably a better measure of
temporal stability than the vowel onset to release, given its inherent
higher cohesion.

It is possible that the temporal stability of the release to release
interval is not an antecedent, but rather a consequence of manipulating
vowel and closure durations. If this were the case, the differential
duration of vowels and closures would not be the result of a
compensatory mechanism. The present data cannot disambiguate between
these two scenarios, and future studies should look into investigating
independent reasons for the release to release interval stability across
voicing contexts. The account of gestural phasing proposed by
\citet{tilsen2013, tilsen2016} is promising, in that the temporal
stability of the release to release interval would directly follow from
the relative phasing of the vowels in CVCV words (see Figure 6 in
\citealt{tilsen2013}). Articulatory work on the gestural coordination of
sequences besides the traditional syllable might reveal a principled
organisation that results in the temporal patterns observed in this
study and in other durational phenomena.

However, even if independent reasons for the interval stability can be
identified, other mechanisms, unrelated to compensatory effects, would
still be required to explain the differential timing of the VC boundary
within that interval. Accounts compatible with other aspects of
production and perception would not be ultimately ruled out, as
thoroughly discussed in \citet{begus2017}. For example, the laryngeal
adjustment hypothesis \citep{halle1967a} states that adjustments of the
glottis for obstruent voicing require more time to be implemented, so
that stop closure onset (VC boundary) for a voiced stops will be
achieved later than that of a voiceless stop, relative to the onset of
the preceding vowel. Tongue root advancement
\citep{rothenberg1967, westbury1983, ohala2011} could also play a role
in modulating the time required before closure can be implemented.
Another account \citep{chen1970} makes direct reference to velocity of
the closing gesture, which is faster in voiceless than in voiced stops
\citep{van-summers1987, de-jong1991}, so that the VC boundary within the
release to release would be timed earlier in the former than in the
latter case. Moreover, perceptual explanations of the voicing effect
have been proposed in \citet{javkin1976} and \citet{kluender1988}, and
these perceptual factors might play a role in the enhancement of the
effect (see \citealt{port1982}; \citealt{luce1985};
\citealt{kingston1994}; see \citealt{fowler1992} for a critique to
\citealt{kluender1988}). Finally, whether the timing of the VC boundary
depends on modulations of the vocalic or consonantal gesture, or both,
is another aspect that should be investigated further (see
\citealt{de-jong1991} for an example).

A comment is also due in relation to possible coexisting effects on
vowel duration. \citet{begus2017} finds that, even when C2 closure
duration is controlled for, C2 phonation (ejective, voiceless, voiced)
in Georgian is still a significant predictor. The author argues for a
separate laryngeal features effect, which operates in addition to a
closure duration effect. In the present study, C2 voicing (voiceless,
voiced) and its interactions are not significant when included in the
model discussed in section \Cref{s:vcduration}, which has vowel duration
as outcome and C2 closure duration as one of the
predictors.\footnote{Multicollinearity is not an issue here, since the VIFs are all below 3 \citep{zuur2010}.}
However, even when multicollinearity between predictors is minimal,
presence or lack of statistical significance of multiple terms cannot
unequivocally inform us on the actual contribution of those terms, since
it is possible that unknown relations between terms mask underlying
mechanisms (for a discussion see \citealt{mcelreath2015}). The
diachronic development of context-driven statistical sub-distributions
can override the original causal link \citep{soskuthy2013}. Under this
scenario, it is not possible to discern which of the competing
predictors is diachronically responsible for the relation, and either or
both the compensatory mechanism and the laryngeal features could have
had a role in generating the synchronic patterns (this kind of reasoning
is compatible for example with exemplar theories of speech perception
and production, see among others
\citealt{johnson1997, ambridge2018, soskuthy2018, todd2019}).

Since diverging results have been obtained in relation to the
significance of C2 phonation in addition to C2 closure durations, these
aspects need to be further investigated in future studies, although to
ascertain whether they are artefacts of statistical procedures or if
they reflect an underlying state of affairs might still prove difficult.
To conclude, lack of significance of a separate laryngeal features
effect in this study cannot be taken as evidence for its absence in the
present data, and a compensatory mechanism could coexist with mechanisms
directly related to laryngeal features, which would in turn explain the
differential timing of the VC boundary.

\subsection{Limitations and future
work}\label{limitations-and-future-work}}

The generalisations put forward in this paper strictly apply to
disyllabic words with a stressed vowel in the first syllable, flanked by
single stops. First, it is possible that the pattern found in this
context does not occur in sequences including an unstressed vowel. For
example, it is known that the difference in closure duration between
voiceless and voiced stops is not stable when the stops precede a
stressed vowel, although vowels preceding pre-stress stops have slightly
different durations \citep{davis1989}. According to the mechanism
proposed here, the absence of differences in closure duration should
correspond to the absence of differences in vowel duration. Second, it
is known that the magnitude of the effect of voicing is modulated by
other prosodic characteristics, like the number of syllables in the
word, presence/absence of focus, and position within the sentence
\citep{sharf1962, klatt1973, laeufer1992, de-jong2004}. Third, the
constraints on experimental material enforced by the use of ultrasound
tongue imaging have been previously mentioned in \Cref{s:materials}.
Given these constraints, temporal information from other vowels (like
front vowels), places and manners of articulation is a desideratum. Data
from different contexts and different languages is thus needed to assess
the generality of the claims put forward in this paper.

Another issue is the interaction of the temporal compensation and speech
rate. The magnitude of compensation between vowel and closure duration
found in \citet{de-jong1991} and here is somewhat small (between 12\%
and 40\%). Ideally, given the temporal stability of the release to
release interval relative to C2 voicing, the compensation rates should
approximate 100\%. However, it is possible that the correlation between
vowel and closure duration is modulated in complex ways by the
individual effects of speech rate on the vowel and the closure. For
example, \citet{ko2018} finds that the vowel/closure ratio differs
depending on speaking rate and that there is an interaction between the
voicing of the consonant and speaking rate. When the consonant is
voiceless, the vowel/closure ratio is smaller when speaking rate is
slow, while slow speaking rate induces larger vowel/closure values when
the consonant is voiced. Experimental work is required which addresses
the differential effect of speaking rate on vowel and consonant
closures, and how these interact with a possible compensatory mechanism.

Some concern could be raised in relation to possible influences of
English on the native productions of participants recorded in the
English-speaking context of the University of Manchester Laboratory.
However, as reported in \Cref{s:procedure}, conversations during the
session prior to the experiment and instructions were in the
participant's native language. \citet{antoniou2010} show that, in a
situational language context study of Greek-English bilinguals, being
exposed to the native language during the experiment elicited Greek
native-like phonetic values even when the dominant language at the time
of recording was English (the bilingual speakers acquired English as a
second language, being Greek their first). A small effect of L2 could
persist in proficient L2 speakers, as found by \citet{schwartz2015}. The
five Polish speakers with a highly proficient level of English
investigated in that study showed a 10 ms increase in VOT values
compared to the quasi-monolingual base level. While previous studies
focussed on VOT, future work should directly test the influence of
English on the magnitude of the voicing effect of one's native language.

The compensatory temporal adjustment account presented here extends to
other durational effects discussed in the literature. In particular, the
account bears predictions on the direction of the durational difference
led by phonation types different from voicing, like aspiration and
ejection. For example, the mix of results with regard to the effect of
aspiration \citep{durvasula2012} suggests that the conditions for a
temporal adjustment might differ across the contexts and languages
studied. In light of the results in \citet{begus2017}, future studies
will also have to investigate the durational invariance of speech
intervals in relation to a variety of phonation contrasts.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The results of this exploratory study of the effect of voicing on vowel
duration are congruent with a compensatory temporal adjustment account
of such effect. Acoustic data from seventeen speakers of Italian and
Polish show that the temporal distance between two consecutive stop
releases is not affected by the voicing of the second stop in CV́CV
words. The temporal invariance of the release to release interval,
together with a difference in timing of the VC boundary, can cause
vowels to be shorter when followed by voiceless stops (which have a long
closure) and longer when followed by voiced stops (the closure of which
is short).

As discussed in \Cref{s:comp}, the temporal patterns reported here do
not univocally exclude other possible sources for the duration
differential. Multiple mechanisms (both articulatory and perceptual)
could conspire together to produce the observed patterns. Such a
pluralist view has already been proposed for the voicing effect (for
example, \citealt{begus2017} and \citealt{sanker2018}), and for other
related phenomena, like vowel duration in incomplete neutralisation
\citep{winter2011}. For a review of explanatory pluralism in the
cognitive sciences, see \citet{dale2009} and references therein. Indeed,
a hybrid account, which takes into consideration and synthesises aspects
of multiple proposed accounts, is probably warranted, given the
diversity of compatible results obtained so far. Future work will need
to investigate further aspects of the patterns found in this study, with
a particular focus on the effects of different segmental and prosodic
structures and different laryngeal contrasts on the release to release
interval, and in relation to other attributes of consonant effects on
vowel duration.
