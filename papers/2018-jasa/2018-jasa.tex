\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\label{s:intro}

Almost a hundred years of research have consistently shown that
consonantal voicing has an effect on preceding vowel duration: vowels
followed by voiced obstruents are longer than when followed by voiceless
ones
\citep{heffner1937, house1953, belasco1953, peterson1960, halle1967, chen1970, klatt1973, lisker1974, raphael1975, javkin1976, maddieson1976, farnetani1986, kluender1988, laeufer1992, fowler1992, hussein1994, esposito2002, lampp2004, warren2005, durvasula2012}.
This so called `voicing effect' has been found in a considerable variety
of languages, including (but not limited to) English, German, Hindi,
Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Korean (see \citealt{maddieson1976} for a
more comprehensive, but still not exhaustive list). Despite of the
plethora of evidence in support of the \emph{existence} of the voicing
effect, agreement hasn't been reached regarding its \emph{source}.

Several proposal have been put forward as to where to search for the
possible source of the voicing effect (see \citealt{soskuthy2013} and
\citealt{begus2017} for an overview). The majority of the proposed
accounts place the source of the voicing effect in properties of speech
production.\footnote{Two accounts that posit a perceptual cause are the ones by \citet{javkin1976} and \citet{kluender1988}. To the best of my knowledge, \citet{javkin1976}'s proposal remains to be empirically tested, while see \citet{fowler1992} for arguments against \citet{kluender1988}.}
A notable production account, which will be the focus of this study, is
the compensatory temporal adjustment account
\citep{lindblom1967, slis1969a, slis1969, lehiste1970, lehiste1970a}.
According to this account, the voicing effect derives from the
reorganisation of gestures within a unit of speech that is not affected
by stop voicing. The duration of such unit is held constant across
voicing contexts, while the duration of voiceless and voiced obstruents
differs. It is well known that the closure of voiceless stops is longer
than that of voiced stops
\citep{lisker1957, van-summers1987, davis1989, de-jong1991}. As a
consequence, vowels followed by voiceless stops (which have a long
closure) are shorter than vowels followed by voiced stops (which have a
short closure). Advocates of the compensatory account proposed two
prosodic units as the scope of the temporal adjustment: the syllable
(or, more neutrally, the VC sequence \citealt{lindblom1967}), and the
word \citep{slis1969a, slis1969, lehiste1970, lehiste1970a}. However,
the compensatory temporal adjustment account has been criticised in
subsequent work.

Empirical evidence and logic challenge the proposal that the syllable or
the word have a constant duration and hence drive compensation. First,
Lindblom's \citeyearpar{lindblom1967} argument that the duration of the
syllable is constant is not supported by findings in \citet{chen1970}
and \citet{jacewicz2009}. \citet{chen1970} rejects a syllable-based
compensatory account on the light of the fact that the duration of the
syllable is affected by consonant voicing. \citet{jacewicz2009} further
show that the duration of monosyllabic words in American English changes
dependent on the voicing of the coda consonant. Second, although the
results in \citet{slis1969} suggest that the duration of disyllabic
words in Dutch is constant whether the second stop is voiceless or
voiced, it does not follow from this fact that compensation should
necessarily target the vowel preceding the stop. Indeed, it is logically
possible that the following unstressed vowel could be the target of the
compensation, so differences in preceding vowel duration still call for
an explanation.

The compensatory temporal adjustment account has been further challenged
on the basis of the so called `aspiration effect' \citep{maddieson1976},
by which vowels are longer when followed by aspirated stops than when
followed by non-aspirated stops. In Hindi, vowels before voiceless
unaspirated stops are the shortest, followed by vowels before voiced
unaspirated and voiceless aspirated stops, which have similar duration,
followed by vowels before voiced aspirated stops, which are the longest.
\citet{maddieson1976} find no compensatory pattern between vowel and
consonant duration: the consonant /t/, which has the shortest duration,
is preceded by the shortest vowel, and vowels before /d/ and /tʰ/ have
the same duration although the durations of the two consonant are
different. \citet{maddieson1976} argue that a compensatory explanation
for differences in vowel duration cannot be maintained.

However, a re-evaluation of the way consonant duration is measured in
\citet{maddieson1976} might actually turn their findings in favour of a
compensatory account. Due to difficulties in detecting the release of
the consonant of interest, consonant duration in \citet{maddieson1976}
is measured from the closure of the relevant consonant to the release of
the following, (e.g., in \emph{ab sāth kaho}, the duration of /tʰ/ in
\emph{sāth} was calculated as the interval between the closure of /tʰ/
and the release of /k/). This measure includes the burst and (eventual)
aspiration of the consonant following the target vowel.
\citet{slis1969a}, however, states that the inverse correlation between
vowel duration and the following consonant applies to \emph{closure}
duration, and not the entire \emph{consonant} duration. If a correlation
exists between vowel and closure duration, the inclusion of burst and/or
aspiration duration clearly alters this relationship.

Indeed, the study on Hindi voicing and aspiration effects conducted by
\citet{durvasula2012} indicates that closure duration, properly
measured, decreases according to the hierarchy voiceless unaspirated
\textgreater{} voiced unaspirated \textgreater{} voiceless aspirated
\textgreater{} voiced aspirated, which closely resembles the order of
increasing vowel duration in \citet{maddieson1976}. Nonetheless,
\citet{durvasula2012} do not find a negative correlation between vowel
duration and consonant closure duration, but rather a (small)
\emph{positive effect}. Vowel duration increases with closure duration
when voicing and aspiration are taken into account. However, as noted in
\citet{begus2017}, it is likely that this result is a consequence of not
controlling for speech rate. A small negative effect of closure duration
can turn positive if the effect of speech rate (which is positive) is
greater, given the cumulative nature of these effects
\citep[p. 2177]{begus2017}.

Further evidence for a compensatory account comes from the effect of a
third type of consonants, namely ejectives. \citet{begus2017} finds that
in Georgian (which contrasts aspirated, voiced, and ejective consonants)
vowels are short when followed by voiceless aspirated stops, longer
before ejective stops, and longest when followed by voiced stops.
Crucially, stop closure duration follows the reversed pattern: closure
duration is short in voiced stops, longer in ejectives, and longest in
voiceless aspirated stops. Moreover, vowel duration is inversely
correlated with closure duration across the three phonation types.
\citet{begus2017} argues that these findings support a temporal
compensation account (although not univocally, see
\citealt[Section V]{begus2017}).

To summarise, a compensatory temporal adjustment account has been
proposed to explain the voicing effect. According to such account, the
difference in vowel duration before consonants varying in voicing (and
possibly other phonation types) is the outcome of a compensation between
vowel and closure duration. After a careful review of the critiques
advanced by \citet{chen1970} and \citet{maddieson1976}, and in face of
the results in \citet{slis1969} and \citet{begus2017}, a compensatory
account gains credibility. However, issues about the actual
implementation of the compensation mechanism still remain. In
conclusion, while the compensatory temporal adjustment account is
plausible on the light of the reviewed literature, we are left with the
necessity of finding a constant speech interval within which
compensation is logically implemented.

\subsection{The present study}\label{the-present-study}}

This paper reports on selected results from a broader exploratory study
that investigates the relationship between vowel duration and consonant
voicing from both and acoustic and articulatory perspective.
Synchronised recordings of audio, ultrasound tongue imaging, and
electroglottography were carried out to enable a data-driven approach to
the analysis of features related to the voicing effect in the context of
disyllabic (CV́CV) words in Italian and
Polish.\footnote{As per \citet{cysouw2013}, the glossonyms \textit{Italian} and \textit{Polish} as used here refer, respectively, to the languoids Italian [\textsc{Glottocode}: \texttt{ital1282}] and Polish [\textsc{Glottocode}: \texttt{poli1260}].}
Given its exploratory nature, this study was not devised to test the
compensatory account, but rather to collect articulatory and acoustic
data on the voicing
effect.\footnote{To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to gather synchronised acoustic, tongue imaging and electroglottographic data in relation to the voicing effect.}
Moreover, the design of the study has been constrained by the use of
such articulatory techniques (see \Cref{s:method}). Since the tongue
imaging and electroglottographic data don't bear on the main argument
put forward here, only the results from acoustics will be discussed.

Italian and Polish reportedly differ in the magnitude of the effect of
stop voicing on vowel duration. Italian has been unanimously reported as
a voicing-effect language
\citep{caldognetto1979, farnetani1986, esposito2002}. The mean
difference in vowel duration when followed by voiceless vs.~voiced
consonants ranges between 22 and 24 ms, with longer vowels followed by
voiced
consonants.\footnote{The mean differences are based on 3 speakers in \citealt{farnetani1986} and 7 speakers in \citealt{esposito2002}. \citealt{caldognetto1979} does not report estimates of vowel duration, but the study is based on 10 speakers.}
On the other hand, the results regarding the presence and magnitude of
the effect in Polish are mixed. While \citet{keating1984} reports no
effect of voicing on vowel duration in data from 24 speakers,
\citet{nowak2006} finds that vowels followed by voiced stops are 4.5 ms
longer in the 4 speakers recorded. Moreover, \citet{malisz2008} argue
based on data from 40 speakers that the magnitude of the voicing effect
in Polish is highly idiosyncratic, and claim their results are
inconclusive on this matter.

The acoustic data from the exploratory study discussed here confirms the
existence of a voicing effect in Italian and Polish, and suggests that
the duration of the interval between two consecutive stop releases (the
Release to Release interval) is not affected by the voicing of the
second consonant in both languages. This finding is compatible with a
compensatory temporal adjustment account by which the timing of the stop
closure onset within said interval determines the respective durations
of vowel and closure. I further propose that the constant duration of
the Release to Release interval is congruent with current views on
gestural timing \citep{goldstein2014} and I discuss the insights such
account provides in relation to our understanding of the gestural
organisation of speech.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

Seventeen subjects in total participated in this exploratory study.
Eleven subjects are native speakers of Italian (5 female, 6 male), while
six are native speakers of Polish (3 female, 3 male). The Italian
speakers are from the North and Centre of Italy (8 speakers from
Northern Italy, 3 from Central Italy). The Polish group has 2 speakers
from Poznań and 4 speakers from Eastern Poland. For more information on
the sociolinguistic details of the speakers, see \Cref{a:socioling}.
Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the University of
Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76). The participants signed a written consent
and received a monetary compensation of £10.

\hypertarget{equipment}{%
\subsection{Equipment}\label{equipment}}

The acquisition of the audio signal was achieved with the software
Articulate Assistant Advanced™ (AAA, v2.17.2, \citealt{articulate2011})
running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows
7. Recordings were made at sample rate of 22050 MHz (16-bit), in a
proprietary format (\texttt{.aa0}). A FocusRight Scarlett Solo
pre-amplifier and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used for audio
recording. The microphone was placed around at the level of the
participant's mouth on one side, at a distance of 10
cm.\footnote{The microphone was clipped onto a metal headset wore by the participant, which is part of the ultrasound equipment.}

\hypertarget{materials}{%
\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}}

\label{s:materials}

The target stimuli were disyllabic words with
C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2}
structure, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o,
u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} =
V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. /pata/, /pada/, /poto/,
etc.).\footnote{Italian has both a mid-low [ɔ] and a mid-high [o] back vowel in its vowel inventory. These vowels are traditionally described as two distinct phonemes \citep{kramer2009}, although both their phonemic status and their phonetic substance are subject to a high degree of geographical and idiosyncratic variability \citet{renwick2016}. As a rule of thumb, stressed open syllables in Italian (like the ones used in this study) have [ɔː] (vowels in penultimate stressed open syllables are long) rather than [oː] \citet{renwick2016}. On the other hand, Polish has only a mid-low back vowel phoneme /ɔ/ \citep{gussmann2007}. For sake of typographical simplicity, the symbol /o/ will be used here for both languages.}
Most are nonce words, although inevitably some combinations produce real
words both in Italian (4 words) and Polish (2 words, see
\Cref{a:targets}). The lexical stress of the target words was placed by
speakers of both Italian and Polish on V\textsubscript{1}, as intended.

The make-up of the target words was constrained by the design of the
experiment, which included ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI). Front vowels
are difficult to image with UTI, since their articulation involves
tongue positions which are particularly far from the ultrasonic probe,
hence reducing the visibility of the tongue contour. For this reason,
only central and back vowels were included. Since one of the variables
of interest in the exploratory study was the closing gesture of
C\textsubscript{2}, only lingual consonants were used. A labial stop was
chosen as the first consonant to reduce possible coarticulation with the
following vowel (although see \citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007}).

The target words were embedded in a frame sentence, \emph{Dico X
lentamente} `I say X slowly' in Italian \citep[following][]{hajek2008},
and \emph{Mówię X teraz} `I say X now' in Polish, and presented
according to the respective writing conventions. These sentences were
chosen in order to keep the placement of stress and emphasis similar
across languages.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

The participant was asked to read the sentences with the target words
which were sequentially presented on the computer screen. The order of
the sentences was randomised for each participant. Participants read the
list of randomised sentence stimuli 6 times. Due to software
constraints, the order of the list was kept the same across the six
repetitions within each participant. The reading task lasted between 15
and 20 minutes, with optional short breaks between one repetition and
the other. The total experiment time lasted around 45 minutes. Each
speaker read a total of 12 sentences for 6 times (with the exceptions of
IT02, who repeated the 12 sentences 5 times, and IT07, with whom words
containing /u/ were not recorded due to technical difficulties relating
to ultrasound data
collection).\footnote{IT01 and IT02 (the first two participants of this study) also read sentences with words starting with /b/, which were later excluded from the experimental design. The data from /b/-initial words are not included in the analysis reported in this paper.}
with a grand total of 1224 tokens (792 from Italian, 432 from Polish).

}

The audio recordings were exported from AAA in \texttt{.wav} format at
the same sample and bit rate for further processing. A forced aligned
transcription was accomplished through the SPeech Phonetisation
Alignment and Syllabification software (SPPAS) \citep{bigi2015}. The
outcome of the automatic annotation was manually corrected, according to
the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}. The releases of C1 and C2 were
detected automatically by means of a Praat scripting implementation of
the algorithm described in \citet{ananthapadmanabha2014}. The durations
in milliseconds of the following intervals were extracted with Praat
scripting from the annotated acoustic landmarks: word duration, vowel
duration (V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant closure duration (V1 offset
to C2 release), and Release to Release duration (C1 release to C2
release). Sentence duration was measured in seconds.
\Cref{f:segmentation} shows an example of the segmentation of /pata/ (a)
and /pada/ (b) from an Italian speaker. Syllable rate (syllables per
second) was used as a proxy to speech rate \citep{plug2018}, and was
calculated as the number of syllables divided by the duration of the
sentence in seconds (8 syllables in Italian, 6 in Polish). All further
data processing and visualisation was done in R v3.5.0
\citep{r-core-team2018, wickham2017}.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

Given the data-driven nature of the study, all statistical analyses
reported here are to be considered exploratory (hypothesis-generating)
rather than confirmatory (hypothesis-driven)
\citep{kerr1998, gelman2013, roettger2018}. The durational measurements
were analysed with linear mixed-effects models using \texttt{lme4}
v1.1-17 in R \citep{bates2015}, and model estimates were extracted with
the \texttt{effects} package v4.0-2 \citep{fox2003}. All factors were
coded with treatment contrasts and the following reference levels:
voiceless (vs.~voiced), /a/ (vs. /o/, /u/), coronal (vs.~velar), Italian
(vs.~Polish). The models were fitted by Restricted Maximum Likelihood
estimation (REML). The estimates in the results section refer to these
reference levels unless interactions are discussed. \emph{P}-values for
the individual terms were obtained with \texttt{lmerTest} v3.0-1, which
uses the Satterthwaite's approximation to degrees of freedom
\citep{kuznetsova2017, luke2017}. A result is considered significant if
the \emph{p}-value is below the alpha level
(\(\alpha = 0.05\)).\footnote{\citet{luke2017} argues that the common approach of using likelihood ratio tests for statistical inference with mixed models leads to inflated Type I error rates. \citet[1501]{luke2017} also warns that `results should be interpreted with caution, regardless of the method adopted for obtaining \textit{p}-values'.}

Bayes factors were used to specifically test the null hypotheses that
word and RR duration are not affected by C2 voicing (i.e., the effect of
C2 voicing on duration is \texttt{0}). For each set of null/alternative
hypotheses, a full model (with the predictor of interest) and a null
model (excluding it) were fitted separately using the Maximum Likelihood
estimation (ML) \citep[p.~34]{bates2015}. The BIC approximation was then
used to obtain Bayes factors
\citep{raftery1995, raftery1999, wagenmakers2007, jarosz2014}. The
approximation is calculated according to the equation in \ref{eq:bayes}
\citep[p.~796]{wagenmakers2007}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayes}
BF_{01} \approx exp(\Delta{}BIC_{10}/2)
\end{equation}

where \(\Delta{}BIC_{10} = BIC_1 - BIC_0\), \(BIC_1\) is the BIC of the
full model, and \(BIC_0\) is the BIC of the null model. Values of
\(BF_{01} > 1\) indicate a preference of H\textsubscript{0} over
H\textsubscript{1}. The interpretation of the Bayes factors follows the
recommendations in \citet[p.~139]{raftery1995}.

The extracted measurements were filtered before statistical analysis.
Measures of vowel duration, closure duration, word duration, and RR
duration that are 3 standard deviations lower or higher than the
respective means were excluded from the final dataset. This operation
(which generally corresponds to a loss of around 2.5\% of the data)
yields a total of 920 tokens of vowel and closure durations, 1176 tokens
of word duration, and 848 tokens of RR duration.

The following sections report the results of the study in relation to

\end{figure}

\Cref{f:vowels-plot} shows boxplots and raw data of vowel duration for
the three vowels /a, o, u/ when followed by voiceless or voiced stops in
Italian and Polish. Vowel tend to be longer when followed by a voiced
stop in both languages. The effect appears to be greater in Italian than
in Polish, especially for the vowels /a/ and /o/. There is no evident
effect of C2 voicing in /u/ in Italian, but the effect is discernible in
Polish /u/. In Italian, vowels have a mean duration of 106 ms (sd = 27)
before voiceless stops, and a mean duration of 118 ms (sd = 33) before
voiced stops. Polish vowels are on average 75 ms long (sd = 16) when
followed by a voiceless stop, and 83 ms long (sd = 19) if a voiced stop
follows. The difference in vowel duration based on the raw means is 12
ms in Italian and 8 ms in Polish.

A linear mixed-effects model with vowel duration as the outcome variable
was fitted with the following predictors: fixed effects for C2 voicing
(voiceless, voiced), C2 place of articulation (coronal, velar), vowel
(a, o, u), language (Italian, Polish), and speech rate (as syllables per
second); by-speaker and by-word random intercept with by-speaker random
slopes for C2 voicing. All possible interactions between C2 voicing,
vowel, and language were included. The following terms are significant
according to \emph{t}-tests with Satterthwaite's approximation to
degrees of freedom: C2 voicing, vowel, language, and speech rate. Only
the interaction between C2 voicing and vowel is significant. Vowels are
19 ms longer (se = 4.4) when followed by a voiced stop (C2 voicing). The
effect of C2 voicing is smaller with /u/ (around 5 ms, \(\hat{\beta}\) =
-14.4 ms, se = 6). Polish has on average shorter vowels than Italian
(\(\hat{\beta}\) = -28 ms, se = 8), and the effect of voicing is
estimated to be about 11 ms (although note that the interaction between
language and C2 voicing is deemed as not significant). Speech rate has a
negative effect on vowel duration, such that faster rates correlate with
shorter vowel durations (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -15 ms, se = 1).

\end{figure}

\Cref{f:closure-plot} illustrates stop closure durations with boxplots
and individual raw data points. A pattern opposite to that with vowel
duration can be noticed: closure duration is shorter for voiced than for
voiceless stops. The closure of voiceless stops in Italian is 77 ms long
(sd = 20), while the voiced stops have a mean closure duration of 63 ms
(sd = 15). In Polish, the closure duration is 69 ms (sd = 12) in
voiceless stops and 58 ms (sd = 13) in voiced stops. The difference in
closure duration based on the raw means is 14 ms in Italian and 11 ms in
Polish. The same model specification as with vowel duration has been
fitted with consonant closure durations as the outcome variable. C2
voicing, C2 place, and speech rate are significant. Stop closure is 16.5
ms shorter (se = 3) if the stop is voiced and 3.5 ms longer (se = 1.5)
if velar. Finally, faster speech rates correlate with shorter closure
durations (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -8.5 ms, se = 1 ms).

\end{figure}

A model addressing the relationship between vowel and stop closure
duration was fitted with the following terms and interactions: vowel
duration as the outcome variable; as fixed effects, closure duration,
vowel, speech rate; an interaction between closure duration and vowel;
by-speaker and by-word random intercepts, and by-speaker random slopes
for C2 voicing. Closure duration has a significant effect on vowel
duration (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -0.15 ms, se = 0.06 ms). The effect with /u/
is greater than with /a/ and /o/ (\(\hat{\beta}\) = -0.35 ms, se = 0.06
ms). In general, closure duration is inversely proportional to vowel
duration. However, such correlation is quite weak, as shown by the small
estimates. A 1 ms increase in closure duration corresponds to a 0.2--0.5
ms decrease in vowel duration. \Cref{f:vow-clo-plot} shows for each
vowel /a, o, u/ the individual data points and the regression lines with
confidence intervals extracted from the mixed-effects model.

\hypertarget{word-duration}{%
\subsection{Word duration}\label{word-duration}}

Words with a voiceless C2 are on average 397 ms long (sd = 81) in
Italian and 356 ms long (sd = 39) in Polish. Words with a voiced stop
have a mean duration of 396 ms (sd = 72) in Italian and 362 ms (sd = 39)
in Polish. The following full and null models were fitted to test the
effect of C2 voicing on word duration. The full model is made up of the
following fixed effects: C2 voicing, C2 place, vowel, language, and
speech rate. The model also includes by-speaker and by-word random
intercepts, and a by-speaker random slope for C2 voicing. The null model
is the same as the full model with the exclusion of the fixed effect of
C2 voicing. The Bayes factor of the null against the full model is 24.
Thus, the null model (in which there is no effect of C2 voicing,
\(\beta\) = 0) is 24 times more likely under the observed data than the
full model. This indicates that there is strong evidence for a null
effect of C2 voicing on word duration.

\end{figure}

In \Cref{f:rr-plot}, boxplots and raw data points show the duration of
the Release to Release interval in words with a voiceless vs.~a voiced
C2 stop, in Italian and Polish. It can be seen that the distributions,
medians, and quartiles of the durations in the voiceless and voiced
condition do not differ much in either language. In Italian, the mean
duration of the Release to Release interval is 210 ms (sd = 44) if C2 is
voiceless, and 209 ms (sd = 41) if voiced. In Polish, the mean durations
are respectively 173 (sd = 22) and 172 (sd = 21) ms. The specifications
of the null and full models for the Release to Release duration are the
same as for word duration. The Bayes factor of the null model against
the full model is 23, which means that the null model (without C2
voicing) is 23 times more likely than the model with C2 voicing as a
predictor. The data suggests there is positive evidence that duration of
the RR interval is not affected by C2 voicing.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

Mixed-effects modelling and the analysis of Bayes factors suggest that:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Stressed vowels in C\textsubscript{1}V́C\textsubscript{2}V words in Italian and Polish are 19 ms longer (se = 4.4) when C2 is voiced.
  \item C2 closure is 16.5 ms shorter (se = 3) if the stop is voiced.
  \item Vowel duration negatively correlates with closure duration, such that shorter closures correspond to longer vowels.
  \item Both word duration and Release to Release duration are not affected by the underlying voicing specification of C2.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The data and statistical analyses of this exploratory study suggest that
the duration of interval between the releases of two consecutive
consonants in CV́CV words (the Release to Release interval) is
insensitive to the phonological voicing of the second consonant (C2) in
Italian and Polish. In accordance with a compensatory temporal
adjustment account \citep{slis1969, lehiste1970}, the difference in
vowel duration before voiceless vs.~voiced stops can be seen as the
outcome of differences in stop closure duration. More specifically, the
timing of the closure onset of C2 within the invariant Release to
Release interval determines the duration of the preceding vowel. An
earlier closure onset relative to the onset of the preceding vowel (like
in the case of voiceless stops) causes the vowel to be shorter. On the
other hand, a later closure onset (like with voiced stops) produces a
longer vowel. \Cref{f:compensatory} illustrates this mechanism.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{img/compensatory.pdf}
  \caption{A schematic representation of the voicing effect as a compensatory temporal adjustment phenomenon. The schematic show the gestural unfolding of a CV́C sequence when C2 is voiceless (top panel), or voiced (bottom panel). Oral cavity aperture (on the *y*-axis, as the inverse of oral constriction) through time (on the *x*-axis) is represented with a changing black line that represents the movement trajectory of an articulator. Lower values represent a more constricted oral tract (a contoid configuration), while higher values indicate a more open oral tract (a vocoid configuration). The black bars below the time axis represent voicing (vocal fold vibration). Various landmarks and intervals are indicated in the schematic.}
  \label{f:compensatory}
\end{figure}

The invariance of the Release to Release interval allows us to refine
the logistics of the compensatory account by narrowing the scope of the
temporal adjustment action. A limitation of such account, as proposed by
\citet{slis1969} and \citet{lehiste1970}, is the lack of a precise
identification of the word-internal mechanics of compensation. As
already discussed in \Cref{s:intro}, it is not clear, for example, why
the adjustment should target the preceding stressed vowel, rather then
the following unstressed vowel or any other segment in the word. Since
the Release to Release interval includes just the vowel (broadly defined
as a vocoid gesture) and the consonant closure, it follows that
differences in closure duration must be reflected in differences in the
duration of the preceding vowel.

On the one hand, the voicing effect can be re-interpreted as a
by-product of gestural timing, rather then a consequence of intrinsic
features of voicing \emph{per se}, with a constant Release to Release
interval as the explanans. On the other hand, the Release to Release
invariance is in turn an explanandum. In the following section, I offer
a gestural organisation account that allows the invariance of such
interval to follow from the relative timing of the articulatory gestures
in a CV́C sequence.

\hypertarget{gestural-alignment}{%
\subsection{Gestural alignment}\label{gestural-alignment}}

\label{s:gestural}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/gorganisation.pdf}
  \caption{Gestural organisation patterns for onsets (a), codas (b), heterosyllabic onsets (c). See \Cref{s:gestural} for details. Based on \citet{marin2010}.}
  \label{f:gorganisation}
\end{figure}

According to the coupled oscillator model of syllabic structure
\citep{browman1988, browman2000, goldstein2006, goldstein2014},
articulatory gestures can be timed according to two coupling modes:
in-phase (synchronous) mode, by which two gestures start in synchrony,
or anti-phase (sequential) mode, in which one gesture starts when the
preceding one has reached its target. \citet{marin2010} showed that
onset consonants in American English are in-phase with respect to the
vowel nucleus and anti-phase with each other. Such phasing pattern
establishes a stable relationship between the centre of the consonant or
consonant cluster and the following vowel. Independent of the number of
onset consonants, the midpoint of the onset, the so-called `C-centre',
is maintained at a fixed distance from the vowel, such that an
increasing number of consonants in the onset does not change the
C-centre to vowel distance (\Cref{f:gorganisation}a). On the other hand,
coda consonants are timed anti-phase with the preceding vowel and
between themselves. Stability in codas is seen in the lag between the
vowel and the left-most edge of the coda, which is not affected by the
number of coda consonants (\Cref{f:gorganisation}b). Other studies found
further evidence for the synchronous and sequential coupling modes (see
extensive review in \citealt{marin2010} and \citealt{marin2014}),
although the use of one mode over the other depends on the language and
the consonants under study.

Consonants can thus be said to follow either a C-centre organisation
pattern or a left-edge organisation pattern. In both cases, of course,
the pattern is relative to the tautosyllabic vowel (the following vowel
for onsets, the preceding vowel for codas). To the best of my knowledge,
no study has reported the timing of onset consonants relative to the
\emph{preceding} (heterosyllabic) vowel. The results from this acoustic
study on Italian and Polish are compatible with a right-edge
organisation pattern for onset consonants and preceding stressed vowels
(\Cref{f:gorganisation}c). The release of C2 (which is the onset of the
second syllable in CV́CV words)---which can be thought as the acoustic
parallel of the articulatory right edge of C2---is invariantly timed
relative to V1 (which is the nucleus of the first syllable).

A consequence of a right-edge organisation pattern of C2 relative to V1
in CV́CV words is that differences in C2 closure duration do not affect
the lag between V1 and the release of C2, as shown by the results of
this study. The invariance of the lag between the release of C1 and that
of C2 then can be seen to follow from the invariance in timing between,
on the one hand, C1 (which is always /p/ in this study) and V1, and, on
the other, between V1 and the right edge of C2.

A right-edge organisation account is compatible with findings from
electromyographic, x-ray microbeam, and ultrasonic data by,
respectively, \citet{raphael1975}, \citet{de-jong1991}, and
\citet{celata2018}. \citet{celata2018} show that vowels before
tautosyllabic clusters have the same duration as before heterosyllabic
clusters. However, vowels followed by geminates are shorter than when
followed by singletons, although from a syllabic structure point of view
geminates correspond to heterosyllabic clusters and singletons to
tautosyllabic clusters (i.e., V-final syllables followed by singletons
and tautosyllabic clusters are open, while those followed by geminates
and heterosyllabic clusters are closed). \citet{celata2018} argue that
these results corroborate a rhythmic account in which the relevant unit
is the rhythmic syllable, i.e.~the VC(C) sequence (independent of the
traditional syllabic structure), which is kept constant. Such view
reflects a gestural timing view in which the timing of the right edge of
the consonant is held constant relative to the vowel.

\citet{de-jong1991} reports that the closing gesture of voiceless stops
(following stressed vowels) is faster than that of voiced stops, and
that also it is timed earlier with respect to the opening gesture of the
stressed vowel. According to \citet{de-jong1991}, the differences in
vowel duration are driven by the timing of the consonantal closing
gesture relative to the vocalic opening gesture (also see
\citealt{hertrich1997}). Moreover, the data in \citet{de-jong1991} show
that the final portion of the vocalic opening gesture is prolonged
before voiced stops. This finding corresponds to what
\citet{raphael1975} reported based on electromyographic data. The
electromyographic signal corresponding to the vocalic gesture reaches
its plateaux at the same time in the voiceless and voiced context, but
the plateaux is held for longer in the case of vowels followed by voiced
stops, indicating that muscular activation is kept for longer.

These studies taken together, plus the results from this study, bring
evidence to the view that two factors contribute to the difference in
vowel duration observed before consonants varying in their voicing
specification. These two factors are: (1) the right-edge alignment of
coda consonants following stressed vowels relative to the latter, and
(2) the differential timing of the closing gesture onset for voiceless
vs.~voiced stops. These two factors together can be synthesised into a
compensatory temporal adjustment account, in which the fixed interval is
generated by factor (1) and the temporal adjustment is brought about by
factor (2).

\hypertarget{limitations-and-future-work}{%
\subsection{Limitations and future
work}\label{limitations-and-future-work}}

The generalisations reported in this paper strictly apply to disyllabic
words with a stressed vowel in the first syllable. It is possible that
the organisation pattern found in this context does not occur in
sequences including an unstressed vowel. For example, it is known that
the difference in closure duration between voiceless and voiced stops is
not stable when the stops precede a stressed vowel, although the vowels
preceding the pre-stress stops have different durations
\citep{davis1989}. According to the gestural interpretation given here,
the absence in differences of closure duration should correspond to no
difference in vowel duration. Data from different contexts and different
languages is thus needed to assess the generality of the claims put
forward in this paper.

The constraints on experimental material enforced by the use of
ultrasound tongue imaging have been previously mentioned in
\Cref{s:materials}. Given these constraints, temporal information from
other vowels (like front vowels) and places of articulation is a
desideratum. \Cref{s:gestural} discusses the interpretation of the
Release to Release invariance in CV́CV words as a consequence of the
timing of C2 rather than of a holistic CV́C motor plan in which the RR
interval is held constant. Although beyond the scope of this paper,
disambiguating between these two interpretations on articulatory grounds
is fundamental for a general understanding of a theory of gestural
organisation.

The compensatory temporal adjustment account presented here extends to
other durational effects discussed in the literature. In particular, the
account bears predictions on the direction of the durational difference
led by phonation types different from voicing, like aspiration and
ejection. For example, the mix of results with regard to the effect of
aspiration \citep{durvasula2012} suggests that the conditions for a
temporal adjustment might differ across the contexts and languages
studied. In light of the results in \citet{begus2017}, future studies
will have to investigate the durational invariance of speech intervals
in relation to a variety of phonation contrasts.
