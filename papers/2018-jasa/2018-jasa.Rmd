# Introduction

This paper reports a previously undocumented correlation between vowel duration and degree of tongue root advancement.
In an exploratory study of the articulatory correlates of stop voicing, it has been found that tongue root advancement---a known mechanism that facilitates voicing during stop closure---can be implemented not only during the closure of a stop, but even during the production of the vowel preceding a stop.
Moreover, vowel acoustic duration turned out to be linearly correlated with degree of tongue root advancement, such that longer vowels show greater tongue root advancement.

One of the known differences in supra-glottal articulation between voiced and voiceless stops concerns the position of the tongue root relative to the front-back axis of the oral tract.
It has been observed that the tongue root is more advanced in voiced than in voiceless stops \citep{kent1969,perkell1969,westbury1983}.
This gesture has been interpreted as a mechanism to ensure voicing can be maintained during the closure of the stop.
The realisation of vocal fold vibration (i.e. voicing) requires the air pressure in the supra-glottal cavity to be lower than the air pressure below the glottis.
During the production of voiced obstruents, the supra-glottal pressure increases due to the immittance of air in the supra-glottal cavity.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to sustain voicing during closure, to the point that voicing ceases if the supra-glottal pressure is higher than the sub-glottal pressure [@ohala2011].
<!-- mention the aerodynamic voicing constraint -->
One of the possible articulatory solution to counterbalance the increase in pressure during the closure of a voiced stop is to expand the supra-glottal cavity by advancing the root of the tongue.
<!-- maybe mention Rothenberg? -->

<!-- need to mention that VOT is typical of voiced consonants in English blah blah blah -->
Tongue root advancement has also been reported as a mechanism for ensuring a short voice onset time [@ahn2016].

An extensive number of studies show that, cross-linguistically, vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents than when they are followed by voiceless obstruents [@house1953;@peterson1960;@chen1970;@klatt1973;@lisker1974;@farnetani1986;@fowler1992;@hussein1994;@esposito2002;@lampp2004;@durvasula2012].
This phenomenon, know as the voicing effect, has been reported in a variety of languages,
including (but not limited to) English, German, Hindi, Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Korean (see \citealt{maddieson1976} for a more comprehensive list).
A common stance in the literature is that the magnitude of the voicing effect differs depending on the language (although see \citealt{laeufer1992} ), and that this phenomenon is not a universal tendency, since the duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following obstruents in some languages, like Polish and Czech \citep{keating1984}.
Although several attempts have been made to explain the voicing effect, an account that survives all empirical data is still lacking \citep{durvasula2012,soskuthy2013}.
<!-- have to say that polish had mixed results -->

To summarise, tongue root advancement, shorter VOT duration, and longer vowel durations are all correlates of voicing.
Moreover, tongue root advancement and shorter VOT show a link.
In this paper, I will report the results from an exploratory study which fill the gap in this picture of correlation, by showing that tongue root advancement is also linked to longer vowel durations.

Eleven native speakers of Italian (5 females, 6 males) and 6 native speakers of Polish (3 females, 3 males) were recorded in the Phonetics Laboratory at the University of Manchester and in a private location in Italy (see \Cref{t:participants}).
<!-- need to update locations and everything -->
The Italian speakers of this study are from Northern Italy (three from the north-west and one from north-east).
The Polish group was more heterogeneous, with two speakers from the West (Poznań), and two from the East (Warsaw and Przasnysz).
Ethical clearance was obtained for this study from the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76).
The participants received a monetary compensation.

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} = V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. *pata*, *pada*, *poto*, etc.), giving a total of 12 target words, used both for Italian and Polish.
<!-- mention why you use these symbols for vowels coz it should be open o in Italian -->
Most of these words were nonce words in both languages, with a few exceptions (see table).
The words were presented using the respective writing conventions (see table).
A labial stop was chosen as the first consonant to reduce possible coarticulation with the following vowel.\footnote{Although there is a tendency in the articulatory literature to suggest that labial consonants do not affect lingual articulations, \citealt{vazquez-alvarez2007} report tongue body lowering in the context of labial stops.}
<!-- check and explain better, is it just during the consonant or also during the vowel? -->
At low power settings and high frame rates, high and mid front vowel have the double disadvantage of being often not clearly visible in the ultrasound image (given their greater distance from the probe) and of producing less displacement of the tongue (essential for the closing gesture identification, see XXX) in the movement from the vowel itself to the following consonant.
For this reason, only central/back vowels (low /a/, mid /o/, and high /u/) were included in the target words.
The use of back and central vowels (with the exclusion of mid/high front vowels) had the advantage of facilitating the identification of the consonantal gesture of C2.
Since the original motive for the exploratory study was to study possible difference in the articulation of closure in voiceless vs. voiced stops, only coronal and velar stops were chosen as target consonants since, of course, the closure of labial consonants cannot be imaged with ultrasonography.
The target words were embedded in a frame sentence, *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' for Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish.
<!-- say that speakers were instructed not to produce pauses and not to speak slowly -->
The similarity of prosodic structure of these sentences ensured better comparability between the two languages.

    \label{f:uti-setup}
\end{figure*} -->

An Articulate Instruments Ltd™ system was used for this study.
The system is made of a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit, an Articulate Instruments Ltd™ P-Stretch synchronisation unit, and a FocusRight Scarlett Solo pre-amplifier (see \Cref{f:uti-setup}).
A TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer (20mm radius, 2-4 MHz) and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used respectively the acquisition of ultrasonic and audio data.
Stabilisation of the ultrasonic transducer was ensured by means of a metallic headset designed by Articulate Instruments Ltd™ (\citeyear{articulate2008}).
<!-- add figure -->
The transducer was placed in contact with the sub-mental triangle, aligned with the mid-sagittal plane.
The headset holds the transducer and it keeps it in a constant position and inclination relative to the sub-mental triangle, thus allowing head movements without the need for post-processing correction.
The acquisition of the mid-sagittal ultrasonic and audio signals was achieved with the software Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA, v2.17.2) running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows 7.
The synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signals was performed by AAA after recording by means of a synchronisation signal produced by the P-Stretch unit.
The ranges of the ultrasonic settings were: frames per second = 43-68, number of scan lines = 88–114, pixel per scan line = 980–988, field of view = 71–93°, pixel offset = 109–263, depth (mm) = 75–180.
The audio signal was recorded at 22050 Hz (16-bit).

The head set with the prob was fitted at the beginning of the experimental session.
Then the hard palate was imaged by recording the participant swallowing water [@epstein2005].
A between-speaker reference coordinate system was derived from imaging the occlusal plane, which corresponds to the trace of a metallic bite plate inserted in the mouth of the participant [@scobbie2011].
The participant gently bites on the bite plate while pressing the tongue against it.
<!-- add image -->
The participant then started reading six repetitions of the sentences with the target words.
These were presented on the screen in a randomised order across participants, although the order was kept the same for each repetition within participant due to design constraints of the AAA software.
<!-- say grand total -->

## Data processing and analysis

### Acoustic data

The audio data was subject to force alignment using the SPeech Phonetisation Alignment and Syllabification software (SPPAS) [@bigi2015].
The outcome of the automatic alignment was then manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}, which were mainly based on properties of the the spectrogram.
<!-- add reference -->
The release C2 was detected automatically in Praat [@boersma2016] by means of the burst-detection algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.
The durations of the following intervals were extracted from the annotated acoustic landmarks using a scripted procedure in Praat: vowel duration (V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant duration (V1 offset to V2 onset), and closure duration (V1 offset to C2 release).

### Ultrasonic data

Mid-sagittal tongue contours were obtained from the ultrasonic data according to the following method.
Smoothing splines were automatically fitted to the visible tongue contours in AAA.
Manual correction was then applied in cases of clear tracking errors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement within consonant closure was then calculated in AAA following the method described in @strycharczuk2015, which is based on the velocity of tongue displacement along a vector.
To obtain the time of maximum displacement, a fan-like frame consisting of 42 equidistant radial lines is used as the coordinate system.
The origin of the 42 fan-lines coincides with the centre of the ultrasonic transducer, such that each fan-line is parallel to the direction of the ultrasonic scan lines.
Tongue displacement was thus calculated as the displacement of the fitted splines along the fan-line vectors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement was the time of greater displacement along the vector that showed the greatest standard deviation of displacement.
The fan-lines from which the relevant vector was chosen were restricted to the fan-lines corresponding to the tongue tip for coronal consonants, and to the fan-lines corresponding to the tongue dorsum for velar consonants.
<!-- The displacement was calculated based on the movement of the splines along one of the 42 fan lines.
Fan line selection in this study was achieved by finding the fan line within the relevant area of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for velar consonants) with the highest standard deviation of displacement.
-->

The polar coordinates of the tongue contours were exported from two time points: the onset of C2 closure, and the time of maximum tongue displacement (which is always within C2 closure).
The contours were normalised within speaker by applying offsetting and rotation relative to the participant’s occlusal plane [@scobbie2011].
