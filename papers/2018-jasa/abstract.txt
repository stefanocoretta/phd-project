A hundred years of phonetic research have established the cross-linguistic existence of the so called 'voicing effect', by which vowels tend to be shorter when followed by voiceless stops and longer when the following stop is voiced.

However, no agreement is found among scholars regarding the source of this effect, and several causal accounts have been advanced.
A notable one is the compensatory temporal adjustment account, according to which the duration of the vowel is simply inversely correlated with the stop closure duration (voiceless stops have longer closure durations than voiced stops).

The compensatory account has been criticised due to the lack of empirical support and its vagueness regarding the temporal interval within which compensation is implemented.

The results from this exploratory study of Italian and Polish suggest that the duration between two consecutive stop releases in CVCV words in these languages is not affected by the voicing of the second stop.

The durational difference of the first vowel then will follow from differences in closure durations of the following stop.

It is proposed that these findings agree with current views on gestural timing and could further our understanding of the gestural organisation of speech.
