# The cemetery of sentences

@soskuthy2013 divides the most notable into two categories: production accounts, which place the source of durational difference in the articulatory system, and perception accounts, which instead point to properties of the perceptual/auditory system as the cause of the voicing effect.
Since the present study focusses on production, the latter will not be discussed further [see @fowler1992 for arguments against perceptual accounts].
Four main proposal within the production side of the accounts will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
Moreover, even though it is amply recognised that different manner of articulation influences the size of effect, this paper focusses on stops.
Two accounts relate the voicing effect to some constant property of speech that is held constant across contexts while the local property of voiceless vs. voiced obstruents varies, thus creating a trade-off solution within the constant property.
@belasco1953 and @delattre1962 argued that the constant property is the articulatory force, such that this force is stable within the syllable.
Since, as they go, voiceless stops require a greater articulatory force, less force is employed in the production of the vowel preceding the stop.
Such reduced force of articulation results in a shorter vowel.
Vice versa, voiced stops require less force, leaving the articulation of preceding vowels stronger.
Vowels before weakly articulated stops can be long.
The second theory, instead, argues that the relevant invariant property of speech is a constant durational interval within which segments of different duration results in different duration of other segments [@slis1969; @lehiste1970].
Both the syllable and the words has been proposed as the fixed interval.
The closure of voiced stops is shorter than that of voiceless stops.
It follows that vowels followed by shorter closures (like in the case of voiced stops) are longer than vowels followed by longer closures (like in the case of voiceless stops).

The other two accounts argue instead that the difference in vowel duration is brought about by differences in gestural timing regarding either the vocal folds (hence properties of phonation) or the consonant closing gesture (hence properties of supra-glottal articulation).
Chen finds no evidence of difference in glottal configuration
According to the former account, the configuration of the larynx for the production of voicing during the closure of a stop consonant is different

say that none of these works with the aspiration effect

*P*-values were obtained with likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model with a nested model without the relevant predictor.
All `lmer` models were fitted using maximum likelihood estimation (`REML = FALSE`) and treatment contrasts for factors.

@marin2010 showed that coda consonants in American English are timed relative to the preceding vowel in such a way that the left-edge of the coda consonant is stable across contexts.
On the other hand, onset consonants follow a C-centre pattern, by which is the mid-way distance between the left and the right edge of the consonant that is stable.

On maddieson1976.
This considered, I think the aspiration effect is indeed compatible with a compensatory temporal adjustment account.
Such claim will need to be verified in future work.
