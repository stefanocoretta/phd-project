Title: Temporal (in)stability in English monosyllabic and disyllabic words: Insights on the effect of voicing on vowel duration
Journal: Journal of Phonetics

Dear Dr. Coretta,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to Journal of Phonetics. While this paper is definitely of potential interest to readers of Journal of Phonetics, the reviewers raise concerns that lead me to reject this manuscript.

The three reviews appear below in this message. Reviewer 1, who I asked to evaluate the statistical methods, approves of these and has a few suggestions you may want to consider implementing. Both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 wondered about the choice of priors and their implications for the study. Reviewers 2 and 3, who evaluated the phonetics claims, raise a number of important concerns that I share. In general, the goals of the manuscript and their relationship to the reported results, and to previous research in this area, are not as clear as they should be. The reviewers indicate that the manuscript needs to say more about closure duration itself and the relationship between vowel duration and consonant duration. These seem like the most obvious quantities to examine, based on the goals of the study, but they are not sufficiently apparent from what is reported. It is also necessary to address the fact that vowel lengthening before voiced consonants is stronger in monosyllables, which seems contrary to the claim that lengthening in monosyllables is a consequence of lengthening in disyllables, an effect that is generally observed to be smaller, and which is not clearly shown in this paper.

You have the option of resubmitting a substantially revised version of your paper, which would be considered as a new submission. If you decide to do this, you should refer to the reference number of the current paper and include a cover letter which explains in detail how the paper has been changed or not, in reply to the Editor and Reviewer comments.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider your work.

Kind regards,

Temporal (in)stability in English monosyllabic and disyllabic words: Insights on the effect of voicing on vowel duration

Review by Shravan Vasishth (I prefer to sign my reviews)

My understanding is that I should be evaluating only the statistical analyses in the paper; I have no expertise in this area so I only comment on the statistical aspects.

I read the paper and the sections reporting the analyses conducted, the appended supplementary papers/documents that summarize the meta-analysis etc., and I looked at the OSF file provided (analysis.R). The author is clearly an expert in the Bayesian methodology, and has done an excellent job of conducting the analyses. I don't see any problems in the analyses presented.

My comments below should be taken merely as suggestions, and the author should not feel compelled to follow them as nothing really serious hinges on these choices.

1. Cauchy(0,25) priors for the residual standard deviation (in the osf file analysis.R) seem pretty large to me. This must have led to divergent transitions and problems with convergence? I suggest either a more informed or relatively vague Half-Gaussian. However, I do admit this should not have any major impact on the results.

2. Figures 1-3 have poor resolution and for someone with poor eyesight (me!) they are also hard to decipher because of the tiny font size.

3. I suggest releasing the code in an Rmd knitted file (html or pdf) on osf, with proper comments. It's generally easier for people to follow the analysis.

4. In the exploratory study, Bayes factors are computed using BIC as an approximation. Why do that if you can compute it within brms or using the Savage-Dickey method? This has the advantage that you can explicitly study the variation in the BF as a function of the prior on the target parameter. I'm generally suspicious of BFs without a sensitivity analysis on the priors (Wagenmakers also takes this approach, in his software JASP for example). Our favored method for reporting BFs is inspired by Wagenmakers and is exemplified here: https://psyarxiv.com/2atrh/. BTW, the recommendations regarding strength of evidence don't originally com e from Raftery, but rather Jeffreys.

Review of Temporal (in)stability in English monosyllabic and disyllabic words: Insights on the effect of voicing on vowel duration

Recommendation: Reject

I feel that what should have been a very straightforward study looking for evidence of temporal compensation between vowel and consonant duration in di- and mono- syllabic words in English, was thoroughly confused and confusing due to lack of explicitness, poor presentation, use of only indirect measures of the quantities of interest, and problematic interpretation of the results.

Sections 1 and 2

The stated motivation is fine as far was that goes. The source of the vowel lengthening effect remains an open question. Temporal compensation has been proposed, but the intervals tested have not supported that hypothesis. The proposal is for a different unit of measurement. This unit is promising because it seems to show temporal invariance across voiced and voiceless stops, a necessary pre-condition for true compensation.

The fact that the duration of V1C2 in C1V1C2V2 words is the same whether C2 is voiced or voiceless implies that the vowel preceding C2 will be longer or shorter because voiced closures are shorter than voiceless. This final piece of the argument is critical, and it is only mentioned briefly at the beginning; furthermore, the actual relationship between the vowel and consonant in the stimuli is never determined! It strikes me as very odd to measure only this interval without verifying that there is a trade-off between the vowel and consonant of interest. Throughout, this hypothesis is re-stated in the following opaque and seemingly-circular way: (e.g., lines 96-101; left column).

Thus, a possible diachronic pathway to the voicing effect in disyllabic words is one in which vowel and closure duration differences emerge from changes in the timing of the VC boundary within the release-to-release interval which affect the voiceless and voiced contexts differently.

Then there is a large amount of information about various articulatory factors that makes it hard to determine exactly what claims are being made. For example, it is unclear what the relevance is of the following information at the beginning of Section 1, lines 133-141 (left column):

Assuming that the closing gesture of both voiceless and voiced stops is initiated in synchrony with that of the following vowel (as per the in-phase alignment), full oral closure will be achieved earlier in voiceless than in voiced stops relative to the beginning of the preceding vocalic gesture, while the timing of the consonant release will not be affected, in accordance with the empirical data. Is the shorter transition period for voiceless stops meant to account for the longer preceding vowel duration? It seems unlikely that this would be a sufficient duration difference. If not, then I don’t know why we need this information.

Vowel duration differences reported are given in absolute terms, which is problematic since there are likely to be differences in speaking rate across studies; at minimum these values should be given as ratios with the word, or syllable duration. I also don’t see what value the “Bayesian meta-analysis” adds beyond a simple determination of the range of results.

The hypotheses in 1) were strange to me. Which is the Null Hypothesis and why?

The articulatory facts from which the stability of the “release-to-release” interval (why not just the V1C2 interval?) is derived also seem to contradict the compensation story. If onset consonants are produced in phase with the following vowel, then C2 cannot start before V2 is initiated, and if V2 is required to be initiated a certain temporal distance from V1, then the release-release interval will only be the same if C2 is kept constant in duration. So obviously something is missing here. If C2 and V2 can both move earlier, then they can be initiated at the same time, and the release-release interval can be the same via effective shortening of V1. If this occurs, then the word itself should be shorter – I don’t know if it is. Or is it that C2 is not considered an onset? The difference between onsets and codas is very important, certainly from the perspective of Articulatory Phonology, but also because, empirically, the strong effect is found in codas (in monosyllables – and actually mostly in phrase-final position, although this was not mentioned).

Statistics

A great deal of the paper was devoted to explaining the statistical methods, and yet some very key aspects were left unclear, such as the motivations, and repercussions, of choosing the priors in particular ways. It should also be made clear what a “weak” versus “strong” prior is. I am assuming it has to do with the amount of variance, but this should be explicit.

Much was made of setting the target precision ahead of time and testing until that was reached. However, this was not done. Therefore, the interpretation of the results seems to be just as, if not more, ambiguous that the significance testing alternative. Additionally, the primary reason for using Bayesian methods, as far as I can tell, is the addition of the prior term. Yet, at the end of Section 2, the author wants to reassure us that the models don't heavily rely on the priors. So, what is the point of them?

Results and Conclusions

The results seem to indicate the following: the release-to-release duration was not affected by voicing; however, it was significantly shorter when the vowel was /i:/. As for vowel duration, the only distribution that does not overlap with the ROPE is the /i:/ vowel again. So, all other factors have little to no effect on vowel duration. However, the interpretation given is that voicing has “a small but robust effect” on vowel duration in disyllabic words (and in fact, it is not clear which aspects of Table 5 support this conclusion – no values are given). Furthermore, we are not told how to interpret the interaction terms; in other words, what is the reference level for each of them? From the text (on page 10), for example, it appears as though the row voicing=voiced is to be interpreted as the effect of voicing on /a:/, rather than all vowels…For closure duration there does seem to be an effect of voicing, as expected, but nothing else.

Therefore, it was found that in English, as well as these other languages, the same interval within disyllabic words was about the same length whether C2 was voiced or voiceless (keeping other properties constant). But relatively little effect of consonant voicing on vowel duration was found. How is this possible if the interval is invariant? Presumably, it must be the case that closure duration differences were within the normal vowel duration variance. The actual effect of closure duration on preceding vowel duration was never calculated. But this must be the real statistic of interest if the temporal compensation hypothesis is what is being tested!

Perhaps the most glaring flaw in this paper is the fact that a temporal invariance that appears to hold in disyllabic words is offered as an explanation for the voicing effect. However, as most studies show, the voicing effect is much stronger in monosyllabic than disyllabic words. Yet, the temporal invariance does not hold of monosyllabic words, so how could this explain the voicing effect?

Summary.
This study investigates the temporal properties of vowel-plosive sequences included in nonce words which were read aloud by native English speakers. The plosives were either voiced or unvoiced and the investigation focuses on how the voicing of the postvocalic plosive impacts on the duration of the plosive closure, the preceding vowel, and the interval between the release of the preceding obstruent and the release of the relevant plosive. The main purpose of the study apparently being that of comparing potential differences across different syllabic contexts (but there are actually various different statements throughout the paper as far as what is considered to be the main purpose of the study), vowel-plosive sequences in word-final position (as in "teep", monosyllabic stimuli) and non-word-final position (as in "teepus", disyllabic stimuli) are compared. Vowels are of three different qualities and plosives can either be bilabials or velars across the experimental set. Acoustic durations are analysed according to Bayesian regression models basically showing that the duration of the release-to-release interval remains stable across voicing conditions in disyllabic stimuli, whereas in monosyllabic ones, the interval is longer in the voicing condition; furthermore, vowels are found to be a bit longer after a voiced than after an unvoiced consonant (with no big difference between mono-  vs disyllabic stimuli) and consonantal closures are found to be longer in voiceless as opposed to voiced plosives (again, with no clear differentiation between mono- and disyllabic stimuli).

Overall evaluation.
The topic is interesting and potentially relevant to the readership of the Journal of Phonetics. However, I think that the manuscript in its current state is not ready for publication and requires substantial modification at several levels: background information, motivation of the study, methodology, structure of the argumentation. I will therefore comment on general flaws that I detect in the paper, one or two for each of these levels, as I think that at least these general issues should be addressed before the paper can be further considered. I apologize that I will not comment on the statistical design, as I am not sufficiently familiar with the specific treatment that is proposed.
Concerning the necessary background information, one major problem that I find is that the Author makes continuous reference to a couple of previous studies by him on Italian and Polish, which apparently set the stage for the current study; however, it is not very clear how they really relate to the current one, as no background information is given about what the expectations for Italian and Polish were (in comparison to the expectations put forth for English in the current study) nor are the differences among the three languages in the relevant domain really discussed. I was startled by the fact that the PDF of the manuscript which I accessed from the system includes, in addition to the text to be reviewed, two additional manuscripts which, if I am not wrong and according to what can be inferred from the reference list, correspond to two unpublished papers by the same Author. No idea if this was an uploading error, but I suspect that it was intentional, as these are precisely the two unpublished papers to which the Author refer throughout the whole manuscript for Polish and Italian. Yet it's a strongly unconventional practice; needless to say, in no way I looked at the content of these two additional papers. So apart from this practical aspect, my feeling is that much more details about how the results obtained on Italian and Polish motivate the current study on English should be provided. In other words, if a cross-linguistic perspective is adopted, then all relevant differences among the languages investigated should be thoroughly dealt with, and the experimental hypotheses should make clear reference to them.
Again with respect to the background information, I would have appreciated more discussion (i.e., again, more background information andthen clearer hypotheses) about variations in closure duration as a function of voicing. This is a very well studied topic in phonetics. The manuscript offers an analysis of closure durations, besides vowel and release-to-release durations, so this is in no way an accessory issues; rather, it is a very central one. Sentences like "there was no specific hypothesis concerning the effect of voicing on closure durations" (l. 971 ff.) are really hardly acceptable in a phonetics paper.
With respect to the general rationale of the study, there is a very crucial issue that I am concerned with. The reasoning of the Author looks like this (taken from lines 1074-1090 on p. 15, but see also ll. 45-74 on p. 2; ll. 211-224 on pp. 3-4): In disyllables, the interval between the release of C1 and the release of C2 (or VC2interval, for short) is temporally stable across voicing conditions in languages such as Italian and Polish, and also English according to the present study, in the sense that when C2is voiced (and therefore, comparatively shorter), V is longer and when C2 is unvoiced (and therefore, comparatively longer), V is shorter, thus the sum of C and V remains stable; in monosyllables, where C2 is word-final, the VC2interval is "less constrained" (l. 1101) because there is no vowel following C2and this would be the reason why its duration in not stable across voicing conditions in English. Moreover, the temporal stability of the VC2interval in disyllables would be the "diachronic precursor" (l. 1014) of the phenomenon of V lengthening before voiced stops, whereas the fact that no such stability is found in monosyllables is an "incongruence" (l. 1033) probably to be explained by historical changes (monosyllables showed originally the same temporal stability of the VC2interval as disyllables, which was subsequently lost, l. 1037 ff.) or perceptual biases (l. 1947 ff.).
In sum, according to the proposed account, the lengthening-before-voicing effect would have originated in disyllables (as a sort of isochrony at the VC level)and then spread to monosyllables. Now, it seems to me that this reconstruction is intuitively in contradiction with most of previous research, which shows that the phenomenon of V lengthening before voiced stops is much stronger in monosyllables than in disyllables. Most of the documentation about the phenomenon relies precisely on the analysis of monosyllables; Klatt himself explicitly stated that the process is induced by domain-final stops (either syllable-, phrase- or clause-final, Klatt 1979). Although present, compensatory effects are weaker in disyllables, where C2is the onset of a different syllable; cross-syllabic effects do exist (not just in English, but also French - O'Shaughnessy 1981-, Italian - Calamai Celata 2011- etc.), but they are generally found to be of a smaller magnitude than intra-syllabic ones. So it looks like we are trying to justify (and even diachronically explain!) a phenomenon, by considering the context in which such pattern is lessrepresented as the one from which everything has started. This is, as I said, at least counter-intuitive: in the present account, the lengthening effect in monosyllables ends up to be treated as an "incongruence", whereas the literature shows that word-final stops are those which vary in duration the to biggest extent across voicing conditions and consequently trigger the most evident compensatory adjustments in the preceding vowels.
All this said, if the Author is really convinced, based on different sources of evidence, that the vocalic adjustments in monosyllables "derive" from the VC2 isochrony of disyllables, it's up to him to convince the reader of this alternative view. In this case, however, many more arguments should be provided, compared to what is done in the current manuscript, to make the point really convincing. For instance, all existing alternative views should be clearly presented and the pros and cons of all of them should be explicitly discussed. Moreover, if diachronic change is invoked to explain why the contemporary patterns are not entirely consistent with the view which is being proposed, more detailed arguments (evidence of sound changes, philological support etc.) should be provided to show that this is really the case - it's not enough to say "it could have been different in the past", as is actually done in the current manuscript, see in particular ll. 1030-1047.
As for the methodology, one major issue in my opinion concerns the definition of the release-to-release interval. This is a very crucial speech object in the manuscript, as much of the investigation deals with its duration across different phonetic conditions. Nevertheless, there is no precise definition of what the release-to-release is, in the manuscript. First of all, consonantal releases have their own duration: does the release-to-release interval start from the beginning or the end of the first consonant's release? And where does it end? In other words, are the releases (one, or both) included in the interval or not? Why? As there is apparently almost no tradition of studies - to the best of my knowledge - looking at such release-to-release interval, the reader should be explicitly informed about why the Author thinks that this is a relevant interval to look at; if other studies do have proposed the analysis of this (or of a similar interval), this should be said. In sum, a much more comprehensive treatment of this experimental variable is needed, in order for the analysis to be fully convincing. Evidently this is not just a methodological issue, but also theoretically relevant.
As for the structure of the argumentation, there are sections in the paper in which the logical connections between successive arguments have to be improved. One such case is on p. 2, ll. 75-128. In this section, there is an attempt to reconcile the segments' relative duration with the articulatory properties of vowel and consonants, based on fundamental tenets of Articulatory Phonology (and ensuing developments of that approach). Provided that it could be a good idea to look at voicing-induced vowel variations from different (acoustic + articulatory) perspectives, the way in which this is realized in the current version of the paper is however not fully adequate. For instance, after saying that the release-to-release interval is an acoustically defined object, it is stated (ll. 75-77) that "however, it is desirable to derive the isochrony of this acoustic interval from properties of articulatory coordination". I think that this position should be carefully motivated to really sound legitimate. Why should it be "desirable" to search for the articulatory 'primitives' of acoustic isochrony? It may well be that this is "desirable" for someone but not for someone else, maybe depending on one's own theoretical positioning, the aim of the investigation etc. And even assuming that there may be a relation between acoustics isochrony and articulatory coordination which is worth investigating, how can we be sure that this is a causal relation, i.e. that articulation predicts/motivates/generates acoustic isochrony, as the Author seems to suggest with the verb "derive"? (I find that there is a general abuse of expressions referring to causal relationships in the manuscript, as in the case of diachronic relations that are loosely postulated to account for the different patterns observed in synchrony - see my comments above. Saying that A is probably related to B does not automatically implies that A "derives" from B; this requires further verification). Similarly, I do not fully understand the logical connection between the argument about the c-centre effect that regulates the articulatory coordination of consonants in onset clusters (ll. 94-112) and the isochrony of the release-to-release interval across voicing conditions (ll. 130-132), given that the latter are singletons varying for voicing, not clusters. By putting these two things together, and adding the observation that the closing gesture of voiceless stops is faster than that of voiced stops (ll. 133-135), the Author concludes the following: "Assuming that the closing gesture of both voiceless and voiced stops is initiated in synchrony with that of the following vowel (as per the in-phase alignment), full oral closure will be achieved earlier in voiceless than in voiced stops [but where does this information come from?] relative to the beginning of the preceding vocalic gesture [but how is it possible to know the timing relationship between an onset C and the preceding vowel, that is the nucleus of the preceding syllable? This is in no way what the c-centre theory allows to predict!], while the timing of the consonant release will not be affected [again, what is the basis for this assumption? what does "not affected" exactly means?], in accordance with the empirical data [unclear which data it is referred to]“.
A final remark concerns the Bayesian meta-analysis contained in Supplement A. Apart from its content, which I will not discuss in details here, I do not find it appropriate to have such analysis (which appears to be an important step in the overall reasoning) relegated to an appendix and its conclusions quickly summarized in the Introductory chapter; rather, I would give it a more central position and a more traditional argumentative structure (aims, methodology, results, implications etc.). In the current form, the reader is presented with data and conclusions without even knowing what the meta-analysis was about, how many papers were sampled, how the sample was chosen, what the specific aims were etc., which is really unconventional for a journal paper.
