# Extraction of wavegram data

The procedure for the extraction of the wavegram data was implemented in Praat [@boersma2018] and is a slight modification of the procedure described in @herbst2010.
<!-- check smoothings-->
The EGG signal is downsampled at ... and filtered with high-pass band filter (0-100 Hz, smoothing 100 Hz).
<!-- say that algorithm is applied to 100/500 ms portion for each repetition of the vowel -->
A glottal period is defined as the interval between two consecutive EGG minima.
The normalised amplitude of the EGG signal of a glottal period is calculated relative to the maximum local amplitude at each sample.
