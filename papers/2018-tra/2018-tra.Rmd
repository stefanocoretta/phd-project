# Introduction

This paper reports a correlation between vowel duration and degree of tongue root advancement.
In an exploratory study of the articulatory correlates of stop voicing, it has been found that tongue root advancement---a known mechanism that facilitates voicing during stop closure---can be implemented not only during the closure of a stop, but even during the production of the vowel preceding a stop.
Moreover, vowel acoustic duration turned out to be linearly correlated with degree of tongue root advancement, such that longer vowels show greater tongue root advancement.

It is well known that voiced stops (broadly defined) are almost universally accompanied by two phonetic correlates: advanced tongue root and preceding longer vowel durations.

## Tongue root position and voicing

One of the differences in supra-glottal articulation between voiced and voiceless stops concerns the position of the tongue root relative to the antero-posterior axis of the oral tract.
The realisation of vocal fold vibration (i.e. voicing) requires a difference in air pressure between the cavities below and above the glottis.
Specifically, the sub-glottal pressure needs to be higher than the supra-glottal pressure for voicing to be maintained.
This property of voicing is formally known as the Aerodynamic Voicing Constraint [@ohala2011].
When the oral tract is completely occluded during the production of a stop closure, the supra-glottal pressure quickly increases, due to the incoming airstream from the lungs.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to sustain vocal fold vibration during closure, to the point voicing ceases.

An articulatory solution to counterbalance the increased pressure is to enlarge the supra-glottal cavity by advancing the root of the tongue.
It has been repeatedly observed that the tongue root is in a more front position in voiced stops compared to voiceless stops \citep{kent1969, perkell1969, westbury1983}.
\citet{rothenberg1967} calculates that the walls of the supraglottal cavity can absorb the incoming airflow for 20 to 30 ms by passive expansion, after which the sub- and supra-glottal pressures would equalise and voicing cease.
\citet{rothenberg1967} thus argues that a passive expansion of the pharyngeal walls is not sufficient.

According to \citet{rothenberg1967}, a complete ballistic forward gesture of the tongue root has a time constant of 70 to 90 ms.
Given that stop closures are generally shorter than that, it is natural that advancement is initiated during the vowel, so that an appreciable amount of advancement is obtained when closure is achieved.
Furthermore, \citet{westbury1983} finds that tongue root advancement is initiated before achievement of full closure and that there is a forward movement even in the context of voiceless stops.

However, the relationship between tongue root advancement and voicing is a complex one.
First, tongue root advancement is not the only mechanism for sustaining voicing during a stop \citep{rothenberg1967, westbury1983, ohala2011} and it has a certain level of idiosyncrasy \citep{ahn2016}.
Other solutions include expansion of the lateral walls of the pharynx [], larynx lowering \citep{riordan1980}, opening of the velopharyngeal port \citep{yanagihara1966}, producing a retroflex occlusion \citep{sprouse2008}.
Second, implementation of tongue root advancement can be decoupled from the presence of actual vocal fold vibration.
In \citet{westbury1983}, advancement of the tongue root is found even in the context of voiceless stops, which is counterintuitive given that tongue root advancement is generally considered to be a feature of voiced stops.
Similarly, \citet{ahn2015, ahn2016, ahn2018} find that the tongue root is more advanced in the phonologically voiced stops independent of whether they actually show vocal fold vibration or not.

## Vowel duration and voicing

A great number of studies showed that, cross-linguistically, vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents than when they are followed by voiceless obstruents [@house1953; @peterson1960; @chen1970; @klatt1973; @lisker1974; @farnetani1986; @fowler1992; @hussein1994; @esposito2002; @lampp2004; @durvasula2012].
This so-called 'voicing effect' has been reported in a variety of languages,
including (but not limited to) English, German, Hindi, Russian, Arabic, and Korean, and Italian (see \citealt{maddieson1976} and \citealt{begus2017} for a more comprehensive list).
Polish is usually given as an example of a language which lacks the voicing effect.
However, the results for are mixed.
While \citet{keating1984} finds no statistical difference in vowel durations before voiceless vs. voiced stops, \citet{nowak2006} reports a 4.5 ms effect and the data in \citet{malisz2008} suggest an effect of 3.5 ms.
\citet{begus2017} argues that the null finding in \citet{keating1984} could be due to low statistical power.
The data from this study indicates that the raw mean difference in vowel duration in Polish is about 7.5 ms (see \citealt{coretta2018j} for a detailed discussion).
While the existence of the voicing effect is supported by abundant empirical evidence, no agreement has been reached regarding its causes \citep{durvasula2012, soskuthy2013}.

To summarise, tongue root advancement and longer vowel durations are correlates of voicing.
Moreover, tongue root advancement and shorter VOT show a link.
In this paper, I will report the results from an exploratory study which fill the gap in this picture of correlation, by showing that tongue root advancement is also linked to longer vowel durations.

Participants were recruited in Manchester (UK), and Verbania (Italy)
Eleven native speakers of Italian (5 females, 6 males) and 6 native speakers of Polish (3 females, 3 males) participated in this study.
Most speakers of Italian are originally from the North of Italy, while 3 are from Central Italy.
The Polish speakers came from different parts of Poland (2 from the west, 3 from the centre, and 1 from the east).
This study has been approved by the SALC Ethics committee of the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76).
The participants signed a written consent and received a monetary compensation of £10.

## Equipment

    \label{f:uti-setup}
\end{figure*} -->

Simultaneous recordings of audio and ultrasound tongue imaging were obtained in the Phonetics Laboratory at the University of Manchester (UK) and in a quiet room in Verbania (Italy).
An Articulate Instruments Ltd™ system was used for this study.
The system is made of a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit, an Articulate Instruments Ltd™ P-Stretch synchronisation unit, and a FocusRight Scarlett Solo pre-amplifier (see \Cref{f:uti-setup}).
A TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer (20mm radius, 2-4 MHz) and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used respectively for the acquisition of ultrasonic and audio data.
The ultrasonic probe was placed in contact with the sub-mental triangle, aligned with the mid-sagittal plane.
A metallic headset designed by Articulate Instruments Ltd™ (\citeyear{articulate2008}) was used to hold the probe in a fixed position and inclination relative to the head.
<!-- add figure -->
The acquisition of the mid-sagittal ultrasonic and audio signals was achieved with the software Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA, v2.17.2) running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows 7.
The synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signals was performed by AAA after recording by means of a synchronisation signal produced by the P-Stretch unit.
The ranges of the ultrasonic settings were: 43-68 frames per second, 88-114 number of scan lines, 980-988 pixel per scan line, field of view 71-93°, pixel offset 109-263, depth 75-180 mm.
The audio signal was sampled at 22050 Hz (16-bit).

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} = V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. *pata*, *pada*, *poto*, etc.), giving a total of 12 target words, used both for Italian and Polish.
<!-- mention why you use these symbols for vowels coz it should be open o in Italian -->
Most of these words were nonce words in both languages, with a few exceptions (see table).
The words were presented using the respective writing conventions (see table).
A labial stop was chosen as the first consonant to reduce possible coarticulation with the following vowel.\footnote{However, note that \citet{westbury1983} and \citet{vazquez-alvarez2007} report tongue body lowering in the context of labial stops.}
Central/back vowels only were included in the target words for two reasons.
First, high and mid front vowels tend to be difficult to image with ultrasound, given their greater distance from the ultrasonic probe when compared with back vowels.
Second, high and mid front vowels usually produce less tongue displacement from and to a stop consonant.
This characteristic can make it more difficult to identify gestural landmarks using the methodology discussed in \Cref{s:process}.
Since the focus of the study was to explore differences in the closing gesture of voiceless and voiced stops, only lingual consonants have been included, since of course the closure of labial stops cannot be imaged with ultrasound.
The sentence *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' in Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish functioned as frames for the test words.
Speakers were instructed to read the sentences without pauses and to speak at a comfortable pace.

## Procedure

The participants familiarised themselves with the sentence stimuli at the beginning of the session.
Headset and probe were then fitted on the participant's head.
<!-- A reference for the coordinate system was obtained by imaging the occlusal plane with a metallic bite plate inserted in the participant's mouth \citep{scobbie2011}.
The participant gently bites on the bite plate while pressing the tongue against it to keep it still.
The trace of the metallic plate visible in the ultrasonic image was then used to rotate the tongue data (see \Cref{s:process}). -->
<!-- add image -->
The participant read the sentence stimuli, which were presented on the computer screen in a random order, while the audio and ultrasonic signals were acquired simultaneously.
The random list of sentences was read 6 times consecutively (with the exception of IT02, who repeated the sentences 5 times only).
Due to software constraints, the order of the sentences within participant was kept the same for each of the six repetitions.
The participant could optionally take breaks between one repetition and the other.
Sentences with hesitations or speech errors were immediately discarded and re-recorded.
A total of 1212 tokens (792 from Italian, 420 from Polish) were obtained.

## Data processing and measurements
\label{s:process}

The audio data was subject to force alignment using the SPeech Phonetisation Alignment and Syllabification software (SPPAS, \citealt{bigi2015}).
The outcome of the automatic alignment was then manually corrected, according to the recommendations in \citet{machac2009}.
The onset and offset of V1 in the C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} test words were respectively placed in correspondence of the appearance and disappearance of higher formant structure in the spectrogram.
Vowel duration was simply calculated as the duration of the V1 onset to V1 offset interval.

The displacement of the tongue root was obtained from the ultrasonic data according to the procedure used in \citet{kirkham2017}.
Smoothing splines were automatically fitted to the visible tongue contours in AAA.
Manual correction was then applied in cases of clear tracking errors.
A fan-like frame consisting of 42 equidistant radial lines superimposed on the ultrasonic image was used as the coordinate system.
The origin of the 42 fan-lines coincides with the (virtual) origin of the ultrasonic beams, such that each fan-line is parallel to the direction of the ultrasonic scan lines.
Tongue root displacement was thus calculated as the displacement of the fitted spline along a selected vector.
For each participant, the fan-line with the highest standard deviation of displacement within the area corresponding to the speaker's tongue root was chosen as the tongue root displacement vector.
