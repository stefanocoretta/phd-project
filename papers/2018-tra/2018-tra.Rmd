# Introduction

This paper reports a correlation between vowel duration and degree of tongue root advancement.
<!-- Don't say previously unreported coz you don't know :D -->
In an exploratory study of the articulatory correlates of stop voicing, it has been found that tongue root advancement---a known mechanism that facilitates voicing during stop closure---can be implemented not only during the closure of a stop, but even during the production of the vowel preceding a stop.
Moreover, vowel acoustic duration turned out to be linearly correlated with degree of tongue root advancement, such that longer vowels show greater tongue root advancement.

One of the known differences in supra-glottal articulation between voiced and voiceless stops concerns the position of the tongue root relative to the front-back axis of the oral tract.
It has been observed that the tongue root is more advanced in voiced than in voiceless stops \citep{kent1969,perkell1969,westbury1983}.
This gesture has been interpreted as a mechanism to ensure voicing can be maintained during the closure of the stop.
The realisation of vocal fold vibration (i.e. voicing) requires the air pressure in the supra-glottal cavity to be lower than the air pressure below the glottis.
During the production of voiced obstruents, the supra-glottal pressure increases due to the immittance of air in the supra-glottal cavity.
Such pressure increase can hinder the ability to sustain voicing during closure, to the point that voicing ceases if the supra-glottal pressure is higher than the sub-glottal pressure [@ohala2011].
<!-- mention the aerodynamic voicing constraint -->
One of the possible articulatory solution to counterbalance the increase in pressure during the closure of a voiced stop is to expand the supra-glottal cavity by advancing the root of the tongue.
<!-- maybe mention Rothenberg? -->

<!-- need to mention that VOT is typical of voiced consonants in English blah blah blah -->
Tongue root advancement has also been reported as a mechanism for ensuring a short voice onset time [@ahn2016].

An extensive number of studies show that, cross-linguistically, vowels tend to be longer when followed by voiced obstruents than when they are followed by voiceless obstruents [@house1953;@peterson1960;@chen1970;@klatt1973;@lisker1974;@farnetani1986;@fowler1992;@hussein1994;@esposito2002;@lampp2004;@durvasula2012].
This phenomenon, know as the voicing effect, has been reported in a variety of languages,
including (but not limited to) English, German, Hindi, Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Korean (see \citealt{maddieson1976} for a more comprehensive list).
A common stance in the literature is that the magnitude of the voicing effect differs depending on the language (although see \citealt{laeufer1992} ), and that this phenomenon is not a universal tendency, since the duration of vowels is not affected by the voicing of the following obstruents in some languages, like Polish and Czech \citep{keating1984}.
Although several attempts have been made to explain the voicing effect, an account that survives all empirical data is still lacking \citep{durvasula2012,soskuthy2013}.
<!-- have to say that polish had mixed results -->

To summarise, tongue root advancement, shorter VOT duration, and longer vowel durations are all correlates of voicing.
Moreover, tongue root advancement and shorter VOT show a link.
In this paper, I will report the results from an exploratory study which fill the gap in this picture of correlation, by showing that tongue root advancement is also linked to longer vowel durations.

Participants were recruited in Manchester (UK), and Verbania (Italy)
Eleven native speakers of Italian (5 females, 6 males) and 6 native speakers of Polish (3 females, 3 males) participated in this study.
Most speakers of Italian are originally from the North of Italy, while 3 are from Central Italy.
The Polish speakers came from different parts of Poland (2 from the west, 3 from the centre, and 1 from the east).
This study has been approved by the SALC Ethics committee of the University of Manchester (REF 2016-0099-76).
The participants signed a written consent and received a monetary compensation of £10.

    \label{f:uti-setup}
\end{figure*} -->

Simultaneous recordings of audio and ultrasound tongue imaging were obtained in the Phonetics Laboratory at the University of Manchester (UK) and in a quiet room in Verbania (Italy).
An Articulate Instruments Ltd™ system was used for this study.
The system is made of a TELEMED Echo Blaster 128 unit, an Articulate Instruments Ltd™ P-Stretch synchronisation unit, and a FocusRight Scarlett Solo pre-amplifier (see \Cref{f:uti-setup}).
A TELEMED C3.5/20/128Z-3 ultrasonic transducer (20mm radius, 2-4 MHz) and a Movo LV4-O2 Lavalier microphone were used respectively for the acquisition of ultrasonic and audio data.
The ultrasonic probe was placed in contact with the sub-mental triangle, aligned with the mid-sagittal plane.
A metallic headset designed by Articulate Instruments Ltd™ (\citeyear{articulate2008}) was used to hold the probe in a fixed position and inclination relative to the head.
<!-- add figure -->
The acquisition of the mid-sagittal ultrasonic and audio signals was achieved with the software Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA, v2.17.2) running on a Hawlett-Packard ProBook 6750b laptop with Microsoft Windows 7.
The synchronisation of the ultrasonic and audio signals was performed by AAA after recording by means of a synchronisation signal produced by the P-Stretch unit.
The ranges of the ultrasonic settings were: 43-68 frames per second, 88-114 number of scan lines, 980-988 pixel per scan line, field of view 71-93°, pixel offset 109-263, depth 75-180 mm.
The audio signal was sampled at 22050 Hz (16-bit).

## Materials

Disyllabic words of the form C\textsubscript{1}V\textsubscript{1}C\textsubscript{2}V\textsubscript{2} were used as targets, where C\textsubscript{1} = /p/, V\textsubscript{1} = /a, o, u/, C\textsubscript{2} = /t, d, k, g/, and V\textsubscript{2} = V\textsubscript{1} (e.g. *pata*, *pada*, *poto*, etc.), giving a total of 12 target words, used both for Italian and Polish.
<!-- mention why you use these symbols for vowels coz it should be open o in Italian -->
Most of these words were nonce words in both languages, with a few exceptions (see table).
The words were presented using the respective writing conventions (see table).
A labial stop was chosen as the first consonant to reduce possible coarticulation with the following vowel.\footnote{However, note that \citet{westbury1983} and \citet{vazquez-alvarez2007} report tongue body lowering in the context of labial stops.}
Central/back vowels only were included in the target words for two reasons.
First, high and mid front vowels tend to be difficult to image with ultrasound, given their greater distance from the ultrasonic probe when compared with back vowels.
Second, high and mid front vowels usually produce less tongue displacement from and to a stop consonant.
This characteristic can make it more difficult to identify gestural landmarks using the methodology discussed in \Cref{s:process-uti}.
Since the focus of the study was to explore differences in the closing gesture of voiceless and voiced stops, only lingual consonants have been included, since of course the closure of labial stops cannot be imaged with ultrasound.
The sentence *Dico X lentamente* 'I say X slowly' in Italian, and *Mówię X teraz* 'I say X now' for Polish functioned as frames for the test words.
Speakers were instructed to read the sentences without pauses and to speak at a comfortable pace.

## Procedure

The participants familiarised themselves with the sentence stimuli at the beginning of the session.
Headset and probe were then fitted on the participant's head.
A reference for the coordinate system was obtained by imaging the occlusal plane with a metallic bite plate inserted in the participant's mouth \citep{scobbie2011}.
The participant gently bites on the bite plate while pressing the tongue against it to keep it still.
The trace of the metallic plate visible in the ultrasonic image was then used to rotate the tongue data (see \Cref{s:process-uti}).
<!-- add image -->
The participant read the sentence stimuli, which were presented on the computer screen in a random order, while the audio and ultrasonic signals were acquired simultaneously.
The random list of sentences was read 6 times consecutively (with the exception of IT02, who repeated the sentences 5 times only).
Due to software constraints, the order of the sentences within participant was kept the same for each of the six repetitions.
The participant could optionally take breaks between one repetition and the other.
Sentences with hesitations or speech errors were immediately discarded and re-recorded.
A total of 1212 tokens (792 from Italian, 420 from Polish) were obtained.

## Data processing and analysis

### Acoustic data

The audio data was subject to force alignment using the SPeech Phonetisation Alignment and Syllabification software (SPPAS) [@bigi2015].
The outcome of the automatic alignment was then manually corrected, according to the criteria in \Cref{t:dur-measures}, which were mainly based on properties of the the spectrogram.
<!-- add reference -->
The release C2 was detected automatically in Praat [@boersma2016] by means of the burst-detection algorithm described in @ananthapadmanabha2014.
The durations of the following intervals were extracted from the annotated acoustic landmarks using a scripted procedure in Praat: vowel duration (V1 onset to V1 offset), consonant duration (V1 offset to V2 onset), and closure duration (V1 offset to C2 release).

### Ultrasonic data
\label{s:process-uti}

Mid-sagittal tongue contours were obtained from the ultrasonic data according to the following method.
Smoothing splines were automatically fitted to the visible tongue contours in AAA.
Manual correction was then applied in cases of clear tracking errors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement within consonant closure was then calculated in AAA following the method described in @strycharczuk2015, which is based on the velocity of tongue displacement along a vector.
To obtain the time of maximum displacement, a fan-like frame consisting of 42 equidistant radial lines is used as the coordinate system.
The origin of the 42 fan-lines coincides with the centre of the ultrasonic transducer, such that each fan-line is parallel to the direction of the ultrasonic scan lines.
Tongue displacement was thus calculated as the displacement of the fitted splines along the fan-line vectors.
The time of maximum tongue displacement was the time of greater displacement along the vector that showed the greatest standard deviation of displacement.
The fan-lines from which the relevant vector was chosen were restricted to the fan-lines corresponding to the tongue tip for coronal consonants, and to the fan-lines corresponding to the tongue dorsum for velar consonants.
<!-- The displacement was calculated based on the movement of the splines along one of the 42 fan lines.
Fan line selection in this study was achieved by finding the fan line within the relevant area of the tongue (tongue tip for coronal consonants and tongue dorsum for velar consonants) with the highest standard deviation of displacement.
-->

The polar coordinates of the tongue contours were exported from two time points: the onset of C2 closure, and the time of maximum tongue displacement (which is always within C2 closure).
The contours were normalised within speaker by applying offsetting and rotation relative to the participant’s occlusal plane [@scobbie2011].
