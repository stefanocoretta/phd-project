\title{Response to reviews}
\date{28/11/2018}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

You mention on line 496 that ``language does not seem to be an
informative parameter''. As I read your paper, you analyzed speakers
from both languages together, but you should probably say so in E. Data
processing and statistical analysis.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{} \textit{
I've added "Speakers of both Italian and Polish were analysed together (models were fitted to a single dataset with data from both languages)." on lines XXX.
} \end{adjustwidth}

Line 28 It is not clear what ``C2'' refers to.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{} \textit{
Replaced "C2" with "closure".
} \end{adjustwidth}

Line 127 ``The duration of the release to release 2interval is stable
across voicing contexts.'' It is not clear to me why this interval is
interesting and relevant. The word ``stable'' probably means
``non-significant differences'', but this can simply be due to a lot of
variability.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{} \textit{
I have rephrased that sentence and added text:
"Finally, the temporal distance between two consecutive stop releases in CVÃÅCV words is not affected by the voicing of the second consonant.
According to a Bayes factor analysis (Coretta 2019), the duration of the release to release interval is not affected by the voicing of C2.
Within this interval, the timing of VC boundary (the vowel offset/onset of stop closure) produces differences in the respective durations of vowel and closure, following a mechanism of temporal compensation ([citations]).
A later closure onset results in a long vowel and a short closure, while an earlier closure onset corresponds to a short vowel and a long closure.
Since the closure of voiceless stops is longer than that of voiced stops, it follows that vowels are shorter when followed by the former than when followed by the latter.
As more thoroughly discussed in Coretta (2019), the release to release interval per se does not have a special status, but rather it has been used as a proxy to acoustic temporal stability more in general.
The aspects of the compensatory account proposed in Coretta (2019) that are relevant to the current study are that (1) C2 voicing does not affect the interval that includes V1 and C2, and that (2) the placement of the VC boundary determines the duration of both V1 and C2 closure.
Future studies are warranted to investigate the production and/or perceptual reasons behind both (1) and (2)."
} \end{adjustwidth}

Line 380 ``\ldots{}that the onset of the forward gesture of the root is
timed not relative to the stop closure, but rather relative to a fixed
time point preceding the closure.'' I would be very careful to talk
about ``fixed time points'' in speech. You don't elaborate. Since the
tongue is always moving during speech, movement onsets can be hard to
locate, and you don't do so. You make a similar statement on line 443.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{} \textit{
I've rephrased: "but rather relative to an acoustic/articulatory event preceding the closure (what this event might be should be further investigated)." and "In order to obtain such correlation, the articulatory onset of the advancement gesture (during the articulation of the vowel) should be at a stable distance from an earlier reference point (like the vowel onset or the preceding consonant offset) such that the timing of consonant closure will create the correlation seen in the data.
Although ideally the timing of the onset of the advancing gesture relative to a preceding articulatory landmark should not be affected by the voicing of C2, the velocity of the gesture itself could be different depending on the voicing of the following consonant."
} \end{adjustwidth}

Line 448 Here, you discuss the relationship between movement amplitude
and velocity. There is a strong correlation between them for both speech
and non-speech movements.

Footnotes \#2, 3, 5, and 6 can be incorporated into the text.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{} \textit{
They have been incorporated in the text body.

General comments - This paper has improved very much in clarity. The
author has confirmed that measures of tongue root position were
reversed, and has made efforts to address my concerns regarding
measurement method. I find I still have the same reservations relating
to ability to take accurate, fine-grained measures using the UTI method
- there are issues relating to the fuzziness of the UTI-imaged tongue
surface and the accuracy of the automatic spline fitting with manual
correction. I can't see any other way around this than for the author to
acknowledge these potential problems either in the method or discussion
section, e.g.~in B. Estimates of tongue root displacement, where the
author discusses the small difference in adjusted mean root displacement
(0.77-1.0mm) between the two following consonant conditions. I therefore
suggest revise and resubmit.

  ~~~~L27-30 ``Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that a
  comparatively later C2 onset for voiced consonants results in a longer
  preceding vowel duration which, in turn, results in greater tongue
  root advancement at C2 onset.'' It seems obvious that a later C2 onset
  for voiced consonants results in a longer preceding vowel duration.
  Maybe you need to rephrase as ``\ldots{} indicate that a comparatively
  later C2 onset for voiced consonants, resulting in a longer preceding
  vowel duration, correlates with greater tongue-root advancement at C2
  onset.''

  the word ``robust'', does not seem right, maybe ``tongue root
  advancement is strongly associated with tongue-root
  advancement\ldots{}''
